969386557550530560	2018-03-02 01:39:00	https://t.co/dAZotd1O1u	Ultra-minimalist Light Phone 2 aims to end social media addiction https://t.co/dAZotd1O1u	A startup has built an anti-smartphone for people who no longer want to be obsessed with their gadgets.Called the Light Phone 2, the device is an ultra-minimalist and elegant 'dumb phone' that can send text messages, make phone calls and serve as an alarm clock.Like its predecessor, the Light Phone 2 doesn't connect to social media, email or news websites. Its creators say the Light Phone is a 'phone for humans' and is a device that 'actually respects you.''By allowing you to leave behind your smartphone, it encourages you to spend quality time doing the things you love the most, free of distraction,' according to Light, the company behind the phone. 'We call this 'going light,' they added. The original Light Phone, which could only make phone calls, launched on Kickstarter in 2015. It was purchased by about 10,000 people, according to the company. Light has set up a crowdfunding campaign for backers of the Light Phone 2, which is still in the prototype phase.More features may be added to the Light Phone 2 in the future, such as directions, ride-sharing, music playlists, weather, a calculator, dictionary and the ability to make voice commands.The company noted that it will never add features like email, news, advertising or social media to the device. The Light Phone 2 is designed to be easy on the eyes, with a matte finish that comes in either black or white. The matte finish makes it easier to view the Light Phone 2's screen while outdoors. It has a 4G connection and uses an E-ink display, similar to Amazon's Kindle. The Light Phone 2 actually takes a page from Apple's iPhone when it comes to some design aspects. Like the iPhone, the Light Phone 2 has a power button on the top of the device and a microphone near the top of the display. On the bottom side, it has a headphone jack, a USB-C charging port and another microphone. The right side of the Light Phone 2 has two buttons that are used to scroll up and down through the device's 'roadmap of tools.'The device is designed to be easy to navigate, by not bogging users down with a mountain of apps, functions and buttons. 'We are rethinking what an operating system can be,' the company said in a video showing off the Light Phone 2. 'These are tools, not feeds. It's a phone that actually respects you,' they added. Light noted that the device doesn't require a carrier because it uses a nano SIM card. Users can set it up so that calls or messages are forwarded from their other phone to the Light Phone 2 or they can set up an auto reply on their other phone. Brooklyn-based startup Light has created the Light Phone 2, a successor to the Light phone that was released in 2015.The Light Phone 2 is a 'dumb phone' that can only complete a few different tasks, including calls, text messages and setting alarms.It's in the prototype phase, so more features may be added in the future, such as turn-by-turn directions, music playlists, ride-sharing and weather. Light said it will never include social apps, news, email or advertisements.The company started a crowdfunding campaign to raise funding for the Light Phone 2, which costs $250 and will ship to customers starting in April 2019. Here are the Light Phone 2's specifications: The Light Phone is priced at $400 but is being sold for a temporary discount of $250. Light noted that the device isn't expected to ship until April 2019, which is one year after the Kickstart campaign expires. More features may be added to the Light Phone 2 in the future, but the company says it's ultimately designed to be 'used as little as possible,' in a way that encourages users to leave their smartphone at home. Light said the company was started with the idea of being 'a refreshing alternative to tech monopolies,' like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat. 'Smartphones are engineered to use these human vulnerabilities [of addiction] against us,' the company explained. 'We don't want to be made to feel that we're not enough''We believe objects empower us and help us appreciate our lives even more,' they added. The Brooklyn-based startup's founders, Joe Hollier and Kai Tang, met when they were asked to build smartphone apps at Google's incubator for designers, 30 weeks. While there, they decided they didn't want to create another smartphone app, realizing the 'last thing the world needs is another smartphone app.' They later went on to build early prototypes of the original Light phone, which they describe as a 'phone away from home.' Ultimately, Hollier said the Light Phone isn't meant to be a replacement for the smartphone.Instead, he hopes users will view the Light Phone as a device that can facilitate a temporary break from social media, emails and the overall distractions perpetuated by smartphone addiction. 
969370311232753664	2018-03-02 00:34:26	https://t.co/FNkUP6KDIG	Hypnotic soap-cutting videos are the latest trend in sensory clips https://t.co/FNkUP6KDIG	Soap-cutting has been added to the list of things that can give you a 'brain orgasm' along with sizzling bacon and soft whispers. The newest social media video trend involves cutting or shaving pieces of soap off a block to relax viewers or induce a tingly feeling known as ASMR.Research has suggested that autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), which refers to a tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine, may help temporarily alleviate symptoms of depression and chronic pain.A small group of social media accounts have set out to bring soft, soapy relaxation to thousands of viewers.'Soap-cutting' videos involve using a variety of peeling, chopping, shaving and cutting techniques on different types and colors of soap.One of the most popular soap-cutting accounts on YouTube called ASMR Soap Queen is run by a woman who identifies herself only as 'Z.E.'.'I decided to film soap-cutting videos because I thought people might find it relaxing,' she told Daily Mail Online.Z.E. said that when she started the accounts on Instagram and YouTube, the initial feedback wad mostly negative.'Because it was such a new concept, a lot of people didn’t understand what I was doing,' she said.However, she said the general response quickly turned from negative to positive.'You have no idea how many people thanked me for making a video that helps them study, sleep, relax and get rid of their anxiety. It was like a tiny cure of stress.' Z.E. has been watching ASMR videos on YouTube for several years. She found that soap-cutting was an innovative way to create the tingling sensation. 'How the soap crumbles into pieces and the noise it makes is very appealing,' Z.E. told The Today Show. 'The reason why people enjoy these types of videos is because of satisfaction and how it releases stress away.'In just eight months, Z.E. has posted nearly 300 videos and racked up more than 31K subscribers on YouTube.Her Instagram account has more than 100K followers. When asked about her reaction to her videos' popularity, Z.E. said: 'I was very surprised. My channel gained over 10,000 followers in the first week of creating my page. It was crazy.' The ASMR community has been active on YouTube for almost a decade, even before the phrase itself was coined in 2010.ASMR is commonly referred to as 'whisper therapy' because the earlier videos on YouTube consisted mostly of people speaking softly into a microphone.ASMR is described as a variety of soothing sensations such as tingles, relaxation, calmness, or sleepiness in response to gentle stimuli often including whispering, soft talking, light touches and methodical sounds, according to ASMR University, a website devoted to educating the public about the phenomenon.Earlier this year, a video of bacon sizzling in a pan went viral as viewers reported that it gave them the tingling sensation and helped them sleep. Z.E. said that she personally experiences ASMR tingling from the soap videos, but that many of her fans simply watch them because they're relaxing. In two of her most popular videos, which both have more than 350K views as of Thursday afternoon, feature a shiny, iPhone-sized block of turquoise glycerin soap.She uses a small paring knife to strip curls of soap off the block. When the pieces hit the table they make a dull clunking sound. In another popular video with more than 160K views she uses a more dry and brittle bar of bright green soap.As she runs her knife through the soap it crumbles off in small pieces. 'At first, I knew this sounded quite crazy to cut a soap and film it. As soon as I posted it on my Instagram page, lots of people watched it and they wanted more. I was very surprised and happy to film more videos.' There is very little reputable research available on what causes the tingling sensations. In fact, most of the researchers who Daily Mail Online has approached to comment on the topic have declined based on a lack of knowledge.Only five peer-reviewed studies have been published, including one by British researchers Nick Davis and Emma Barratt from 2015 that looked at people who already reported watching and listening to ASMR content regularly.'The people who participated in our research reported using it mainly for relaxation, and to get a better night's sleep,' Barratt told TODAY.'There was a fair amount of people who also said they used it to lift their mood — we found that those who experience depression can get a pretty big boost in mood from watching and listening to ASMR content.'

On average, these mothers reported being about 76 percent more depressed than those who had moved their baby into a separate room.Though the study authors did not take a side in the co-sleeping debate, they pointed out that sharing a bed may not only cause stress, but make it more difficult for parents to sleep well, making then more vulnerable to depression. The 'baby' blues are a common occurrence for new mothers, as hormonal changes and pure exhaustion combine to work against their mental health. But postpartum depression can be a much more serious and lasting condition. While about 80 percent of women get the so-called blues, only 15 percent of births are accompanied by a mother's postpartum depression (PPD), which usually sets in between a week and a month after a baby's birth, and can last for months.Stress can put mothers at greater risk of developing symptoms - like hopelessness, spontaneous crying, and even violent thoughts - so, efforts to minimize their worries and feelings of insecurity may help to prevent (PPD)Dr Douglas Teti, lead author for the Penn State University study, said: 'We definitely saw the persistent co-sleepers - the moms that were still co-sleeping after six months - were the ones who seemed to get the most criticism.'They also reported greater levels of worry about their baby's sleep, which makes sense when you're getting criticized about something that people are saying you shouldn't be doing, that raises self-doubt. That's not good for anyone.' Co-sleeping with babies is a sensitive subject, with many parents feeling it is natural, or the only way to get their children to sleep is by lying in the same bed with them.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 60 percent of Americans report sharing their beds with their babies at some point.Though the American Academy of Pediatricians stops short of saying that co-sleeping is safe, in 2016 the association revised its guidelines to acknowledge that, realistically, exhausted mothers are going to fall asleep with their babies in beds occasionally.But the official advice is that the practices comes with an increased risk of infant death.This can make mothers who choose to do it more likely to feel depressed or judged, said Dr Teti.He said, regardless of current parenting trends, it is important to find a sleep arrangement that works for everyone in the family.Prof Teti said: 'In other parts of the world, co-sleeping is considered normal, while here in the US, it tends to be frowned upon.'Co-sleeping, as long as its done safely, is fine as long as both parents are on board with it. If it's working for everyone, and everyone is okay with it, then co-sleeping is a perfectly acceptable option.'The researchers said most American families begin co-sleeping when their babies are first born, moving them to their own room by the time they are six months old.In 2015 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) killed about 1,600 babies in the US, according to the CDC.Among babies that are less than a year old, SIDS is the leading cause of death.SIDS can occur for a number of reasons, including:Concerns about sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or the desire for babies to learn how to fall asleep on their own may be why many prefer them to sleep alone. An analysis of 103 mothers in their baby's first year of life saw a similar pattern.Dr Teti said: 'We found about 73 percent of families co-slept at the one-month point. That dropped to about 50 percent by three months, and by six months, it was down to about 25 percent.'Most babies that were in co-sleeping arrangements in the beginning were moved out into solitary sleep by six months.'Dr Teti said the study published in Infant and Child Development was not about whether co-sleeping is good or bad, but the importance of finding an arrangement that works well without neglecting a partner or spouse.He said: 'If you are going to co-sleep, you have to make sure both people in the partnership have talked it through and both people are in sync with what they want to do.'If not, that's when criticism and arguments can happen, and possibly spill over into the relationship with child. So you want to avoid that. You need to make sure you have time with your partner, as well.'Dr Teti also said that even when co-sleeping works well, it can still cause more loss of sleep for the parents than if the baby slept in its own room.He added: 'If you co-sleep, it is going to disrupt your sleep, and probably Mom's sleep more than Dad's. So this is something to be careful with if you are not good with chronic sleep debt.'Co-sleeping needs to work well for everyone, and that includes getting adequate sleep. To be the best parent you can be, you have to take care of yourself, and your child benefits as a result.'An estimated 3,500 babies die from sleep-related causes each year in the US, the CDC reported in January. That number includes cases of suffocation, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and deaths from unknown causes. Last month, a Harvard University study reported that the rate of infants dying in their sleep has not changed in the last 25 years in the US, suggesting efforts to promote safer sleeping practice have gone unheeded. The chance of sudden death goes up when bed-sharing if a parent smokes, has drunk alcohol or taken drugs, or is very tired, they say.Babies are at greater risk of dying during co-sleeping if they were either premature or had a low birth weight. The CDC recommends the safest place for a baby to sleep in the first six months is in a cot in the same room as the parent or carer. 
969347314799214592	2018-03-01 23:03:04	https://t.co/Fmk98kvmEx	World's largest family tree linking 13 MILLION people reveals the fascinating patterns of migration and marriage https://t.co/Fmk98kvmEx	The largest ever 'family tree' spanning 11 generations has revealed fascinating details about the lives of Westerners over the past 500 years.Scientists trawled 86 million profiles from a genealogy website to uncover a 'family' of 13 million people from Europe and North America.By looking at their genetic data, they were able to piece together their migrations, marriages and lifespans.The results showed that before the Industrial Revolution in the US, Canada and Europe, there was a high chance people would end up marrying a fourth cousin.According to the genetic data, most people would only travel six-miles (10km) of where they were born to find a partner. By looking at lifespan differences between more than three million pairs of relatives, the study also found that your chances of living longer boil down to your genes about 16 per cent of the time.Scroll down for video 'The reconstructed pedigrees show that we are all related to each other,' said Peter Visscher, a quantitative geneticist at University of Queensland who was not involved in the study.'This fact is known from basic population history principles, but what the authors have achieved is still very impressive.' To construct the family tree, researchers, downloaded 86 million public profiles from Geni.com, a collaborative genealogy website owned by MyHeritage.From the data - which focused mostly on people who originated in Europe and North America - interconnected profiles began to converge into one massive tree of 13 million people. 'Users can create profiles and they can upload their own family trees and what makes it really unique is that Geni scans the profiles for similarities and merges those trees if they see the match of a person,' said lead researcher Joanna Kaplanis from the Wellcome Sanger Institute.'So if the same person appears in multiple trees, they'll offer to merge those trees.' Distance people travelled to find love Scientists found recent reduction in genetic relatedness in Western societies had more to do with shifting cultural factors than it did with the advent of transportation.'Even when people started to move away they were still marrying people who were quite related to them. There was around a 50 year lag', said Dr Kaplanis.'It seems that it was cultural differences that changed that norm', she said.Before 1850, marrying in the family was common - to someone who was, on average, a fourth cousin, compared to seventh cousins today.Looking at migration patterns, researchers led by Columbia University found females migrate more than males in Western societies, but over shorter distances.Before 1750, most Americans found a spouse within six miles (10 kilometres) of where they were born.However, for those born in 1950, that distance had stretched to about 60 miles (100 kilometres) as it 'became harder to find the love of your life', researchers found.Changing social norms, rather than rising mobility, may have led people to shun close kin as marriage partners, researchers say.Before 1850, marrying in the family was common - to someone who was, on average, a fourth cousin, compared to seventh cousins today.Curiously, the researchers found that between 1800 and 1850, people travelled farther than ever to find a mate - nearly 12 miles (19 kilometres) on average - but were more likely to marry a fourth cousin or closer.'It became harder to find the love of your life,' said Yaniv Erlich a computer scientist at Columbia University and Chief Science Officer at MyHeritage, a genealogy and DNA testing company that owns Geni.com.Scientists found recent reduction in genetic relatedness in Western societies had more to do with shifting cultural factors than it did with the advent of transportation.'Even when people started to move away they were still marrying people who were quite related to them. There was around a 50 year lag', said lead researcher Joanna Kaplanis from the Wellcome Sanger Institute.'It seems that it was cultural differences that changed that norm', she said. 'We were able to track different migration events. You can see as people start being born in different places you can see when Columbus landed in the US and when the Dutch went to South Africa', said Dr Kaplanis.Curiously, the researchers found that between 1800 and 1850, people travelled farther than ever to find a mate - nearly 12 miles (19 kilometres) on average - but were more likely to marry a fourth cousin or closer. 'It became harder to find the love of your life,' said Yaniv Erlich a computer scientist at Columbia University and Chief Science Officer at MyHeritage, a genealogy and DNA testing company that owns Geni.com.How did they work out longevity?Another aspect of the study was working out whether longevity was largely down to our genes or lifestyle choices.To try and untangle the role of nature and nurture, the researchers built a model and trained it on a dataset of 3 million relatives born between 1600 and 1910 who had lived past the age of 30.They excluded twins, individuals who died in the US Civil War, World War I and II, or in a natural disaster (inferred if relatives died within 10 days of each other). They compared each individual's lifespan to that of their relatives. They found that genes explained about 16 per cent of the longevity variation seen in their data - on the low end of previous estimates which have ranged from about 15 per cent to 30 per cent.'The results indicate that good longevity genes can extend someone's life by an average of five years, said Dr Erlich.'That's not a lot,' he added.Previous studies have shown that smoking takes 10 years off of your life. That means some life choices could matter a lot more than genetics. Significantly, the study also shows that the genes that influence longevity act independently rather than interacting with each other, a phenomenon called epistasis. Some scientists have used epistasis to explain why large-scale genomic studies have so far failed to find the genes that encode complex traits like intelligence or longevity.If some genetic variants act together to influence longevity, the researchers would have seen a greater correlation among closely related individuals who share more DNA, and thus more genetic interactions. However, they found a linear link between longevity and genetic relatedness, ruling out widespread epistasis. How did they verify their data? In order to check that the dataset was representative of the general US population, researchers cross-checked the subset of Vermont on Geni.com with profiles against the state's death registry.'There is a geographical bias as most of our users are from Europe or the US so we don't have a global view', said Dr Kaplanis.'However, to test this socio-economic bias we collected death certificates from the Vermont department of health and matched those death certificates to the data in the tree', she said.Researchers also obtained every death certificate issued in the state of Vermont, which has an open policy about death certificates, from 1985 to 2000, for a total of nearly 80,000 records.'Through the hard work of many genealogists curious about their family history, we crowdsourced an enormous family tree and boom, came up with something unique,' said Dr Erlich.'We hope that this dataset can be useful to scientists researching a range of other topics', he said.All of the data researchers downloaded is publicly available and people will be able to download their information onto the tree and add to the wealth of information. All of the analysis was done on individuals who are deceased. 'It's an exciting moment for citizen science,' said Melinda Mills, a demographer at University of Oxford who was not involved in the study'It demonstrates how millions of regular people in the form of genealogy enthusiasts can make a difference to science.' 
969343821191569410	2018-03-01 22:49:11	https://t.co/XzGYzHP0eq	Saturn-sized exoplanet 700 light-years away has WATER in its atmosphere, NASA revealshttps://t.co/XzGYzHP0eq	Scientists have spotted a ‘surprising’ amount of water in the atmosphere around a massive planet far beyond our solar system.The planet, known as WASP-39b, sits roughly 700 light-years away and is estimated to have three times more water in its vicinity than Saturn.While scientists have previously drawn parallels between the two planets due to their similar masses, the extreme difference in water content suggests WASP-39b formed in a different way than our ringed neighbour.Scroll down for video WASP-39b is a scorching ‘hot Saturn’ exoplanet in the constellation Virgo.It orbits a sun-like star once every four days, at a distance 20 times closer than Earth is to the sun.And, on the day side, temperatures can reach 1,430 degrees Fahrenheit (776.7 degrees Celsius).On the permanent night side, temperatures are nearly as hot due to powerful winds which transport heat around the planet.While WASP-39b certainly wouldn’t make a nice place to live, the experts say its surprising atmosphere can help improve our understanding of the planets and processes in our own solar system.Scientists initially expected to find water when analyzing the fingerprints of different compounds in the exoplanet’s atmosphere.But, they weren’t prepared to find so much.Based on the high amount of water, the experts say WASP-39b likely formed far away from its star and was bombarded with icy material.Then, it migrated closer in an ‘epic journey’ across its system.‘We need to look outward so we can understand our own solar system,’ said lead investigator Hannah Wakeford of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, and the University of Exeter in Devon, UK.‘But exoplanets are showing us that planet formation is more complicated and more confusing than we thought it was. And that’s fantastic.’Though WASP-39b is compared to Saturn, the two planets are very different in a number of ways – the most obvious being that WASP-39b does not have rings.And, its atmosphere is a ‘puffy’ environment free of high-altitude clouds, giving scientists an unprecedented look at the region around an exoplanet.The team used data from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes to find the ‘fingerprints’ of water and other molecules.With this, they’ve captured what they say is the most complete spectrum of an exoplanet’s atmosphere yet.‘This spectrum is thus far the most beautiful example we have of what a clear exoplanet atmosphere looks like,’ Wakeford said.The Hubble Space Telescope was launched jointly by NASA and the European Space Agency.The Hubble is a space-based and long-term observatory.The Hubble observes ultraviolet wavelengths, which the atmosphere filters out, and it collects visible light.'The Hubble Space Telescope has made some of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of astronomy,' a statement on the Telescope says.The machinery sits more than 370 miles above earth.It can pick up on light via its 'eyes', which are five times more focused than ground-based telescopes.The Hubble focuses on areas in deep outer space 'where some of the most profound mysteries are still buried in the mists of time'.Using the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, the researchers say they could soon obtain an even more detailed look at the exoplanet’s atmosphere, revealing insight on its atmospheric carbon.Carbon absorbs light at longer, infrared wavelengths than Hubble is able to detect, according to the team.With further studies on its carbon and oxygen concentrations, the scientists will be able to better understand how it formed.‘WASP-39b shows exoplanets can have much different compositions than those of our solar system,’ said co-author David Ding of the University of Exeter in Devon.‘Hopefully this diversity we see in exoplanets will give us clues in figuring out all the different ways a planet can form and evolve.’
969338241450172416	2018-03-01 22:27:00	https://t.co/eOBQRQLZiB	Scientists finally discover why 'The Iceman' can withstand freezing cold temperatures without dying  https://t.co/eOBQRQLZiB	Wim Hof has baffled the world of science for decades with his bizarre ability to withstand freezing cold temperatures.But now scientists believe they've figured out why 'The Iceman' has yet to enter a state of hypothermia - which can kill in minutes.And they claim his Wim Hof Method, simply concentrating hard on keeping warm, could work as a painkiller and mood booster.In the first ever trial of the Dutch man's bizarre talent, the 57-year-old and 20 other adults were exposed to 15°C (59°F) water. Body temperatures drop dangerously low in such scenarios, but tests showed the heat of his skin did not deviate once. Striking brain scans revealed a region of his brain that controls pain is significantly more active than that of the participants.During the experiment, Hof's periaqueductal gray matter spiked both times he was exposed to the cold water in a special full-body suit.In contrast, an analysis of the control group - who were affected by the cold water - showed no such spike in the brain region. Wayne State University researchers, led by Professor Otto Muzik, pointed to Hof's own method as the reason why he can withstand the cold.Professor Muzik said: 'The willful regulation of skin temperature... is an unusual occurrence and may explain his resistance to frostbite.'Hof, from Sittard, puts his capabilities down to his self-developed set of breathing and meditation techniques, called the Wim Hof Method.But before now, his strange talent had baffled scientists, as they scratched their heads trying to understand how it was physically possible.Hof holds 21 Guinness World Records, scooping one for spending nearly two hours in an ice bath. Adults are recommended to spend no more than 10 minutes in one. When the human body is exposed to extreme cold, our core temperature drops, causing the body to enter a state of hypothermia, and eventually we freeze to death.But 57-year-old Wim Hof, from the Netherlands, has been able to spend nearly two hours in an ice bath and emerge unharmed.The Iceman, as he is known, has also run a full marathon above the Arctic Circle wearing just shorts.Hof puts his capabilities down to his self-developed meditation and breathing technique – known as the Wim Hof Method – enabling him to control his body’s autonomous hormonal responses.This was tested by researchers at Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands as part of research into the treatment of autoimmune diseases.Hof was injected with endotoxin, a substance that tricks the body into thinking it is under bacterial attack.He should have developed a fever and flu-like symptoms but did not, so researchers concluded that there may be truth to his claims about his ability to suppress his automatic immune response. The findings, published in the journal NeuroImage, offer the first explanation as to why Hof has such an ability to withstand the cold.Hof wore a special whole-body suit containing water that experts could control the temperature of during the three-day study.They measured brain changes through functional magnetic resonance imaging, and looked at what happens in his body through PET scans.His results were compared to participants who formed part of a long-running study looking into how the brain responds to temperature changes. The researchers expected Hof to show significant brain activity changes in a region called the anterior insula, which regulates temperature.Professor Muzik added: 'However, we observed more substantial differences in an area called periaqueductal gray matter, located in the upper brainstem. 'This area is associated with brain mechanisms for the control of sensory pain and is thought to implement this control through the release of opioids and cannabinoids.' PET scans showed it allowed him to generate heat that dissipates to lung tissue and warms circulating blood. Researchers believe the Hof's own method works as a painkiller and mood booster. They speculated it releases endorphins in the brain, which control pain and can produce a feeling of euphoria similar to opiod drugs, such as morphine.In a statement, they said: 'This effect has the potential to create a feeling of well-being, mood control and reduced anxiety.'They now believe the Wim Hof Method could be used to treat medical conditions, from auto-immune conditions to anxiety.Professor Vaibhav Diwadkar, who was involved in the study, said the possibilities were 'too intriguing to ignore'.And Professor Muzik added: 'It is not mysterious to imagine that what we practice can change our physiology.' 
969334236665835525	2018-03-01 22:11:06	https://t.co/2nOk29SgkM	Brain stimulation really CAN improve your memory (but only if you get the treatment when you're young) https://t.co/2nOk29SgkM	Brain stimulation benefits young people much more than the elderly, new research found.Scientists at the University of Illinois have found that the treatment, thought to improve people's memories, does, in fact, work.However, they learned it is not nearly as effective for older people as it is for young adults.The researchers tested two different sets of participants for the new study.A total of 96 people were tested for the study, published in Journals of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences.Forty-eight of them were aged 18 to 35, and the other half were aged 60 to 79.To test the effects of brain stimulation, the University of Illinois scientists asked the participants to memorize 60 face-name pairs.During the experiment, some of the participants received brain stimulation treatments. The others received a placebo treatment - stimulation that was fake.Then the researchers tested the participants' minds immediately after all had received their 'treatments'.They were tested a second time 24 hours after the experiment, the following day.Upon analyzing the results, the researchers learned that brain stimulation is not particularly effective for older people.The study explained: 'Ultimately, the researchers found that while the younger adults showed memory improvement from stimulation, the older adults did not.'This finding is interesting because it goes against what researchers previously thought about brain stimulation treatments.Doctors turn to deep brain stimulation to treat various neurological conditions.The treatment involves the implantation of electrodes into certain areas of the brain.The electrodes create electrical impulses, which regulate abnormal impulses.A device similar to a pacemaker controls the level of stimulation administered.The device is placed beneath the skin in the upper chest. A wire connects the device to electrodes in the brain.Deep brain stimulation can be used to treat:'The results contradict findings from previous studies that showed that a slight electoral current through the scalp had a greater effect on cognition for older adults compared to younger adults,' the study said.Study author Eric Leshikar said the research showed an immense difference in the amount that brain stimulation affects older and younger people.He said: 'On average the amount of improvement that younger adults showed from brain stimulation was a 50 percent improvement in memory.'Importantly, we found these memory improvements both immediately after stimulation, as well as after 24 hours, suggesting that brain stimulation can effectively improve memory.'According to Leshikar, future research on the topic will focus on whether or not the use of different stimulation procedures has the ability to help improve older adults' memories.He explained: 'It very well may be that older adults may show memory improvement from stimulation, but perhaps not under the stimulation procedures we used in this study.'The report said: 'As people grow older their memory tend[s] to get poorer, so finding ways to improve it is an important matter of investigation given the longer contemporary lifespans that people are experiencing.'

Some may only have one 'attack,' or episode, and the spectrum of symptoms range from tingling and fatigue to loss of vision, tremors, numbness or weakness.Most people will develop recurring episodes, during which new symptoms can develop. These may last a period of days or weeks, and for between 60 and 70 percent of people with the disease, it will eventually progress to the point that the symptoms become permanent.Because MS is marked by the body's attacks on its own tissues, it is classified as an autoimmune disease, but its cause is thought to involve both genetic and environmental factors – as best scientists can guess.But most of its risk factors are so broad – things like age, sex, race, family history and smoking – that its onset is difficult to predict, much less prevent.In light of recent research into the wide-ranging health benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids from fish, decided to test the relationship between the nutritious oil and MS.'We wanted to see if this simple lifestyle modification, regularly eating fish and taking fish oil supplements, could reduce the risk of MS,' said study author Dr Annette Langer-Gould of Kaiser Permanente Southern California and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.She and her team asked 1,153 people about what kinds of fish they ate and how often, and if they took fish oil supplements. Roughly half of the group had been diagnosed with a form of MS – either a first, isolated incident of symptoms, or a recurring form.Those that consumed more fish or fish oil had a 45 percent lower risk of MS than the rest of the group.The bar for 'high fish intake' was eating the seafood – especially salmon, sardines, albacore tuna and late trout - once a week or between once and three times a month while also taking daily fish oil supplements.Of the MS group, 180 people had 'high fish intakes,' compared to 250 people in the group without MS.The researchers also looked at 13 genetic factors that determine, in part, how the body processes and regulates levels of fatty acids.They linked two of these genetic variations to lower risks of MS as well, regardless of their fish-intake, suggesting that some people's bodies may naturally be better equipped to regulate fatty acid levels.Other studies have also suggested that fatty acids from fish or fish oil may help to keep MS symptoms at bay and minimize relapses.It is not entirely clear what gives the oils their protective powers, but some scientists hypothesize that their general anti-inflammatory effects are particularly good for MS sufferers, and that this good fat may help to shield and protect neurons.The research suggests that a diet high in fish or fish oil might play a role in preventing and assuaging symptoms of MS, the study draws a connection, not a conclusion about the effects. 
969324165152104455	2018-03-01 21:31:04	https://t.co/T1s8bYCMyj	All the health facts you need to know about quinoa https://t.co/T1s8bYCMyj	Crazy about quinoa? Join the club. Quinoa has been around for ages, it hit the health-food world hard in 2012. Before long, it was practically everywhere. Most people turned to quinoa for its health benefits. People on strict diets used it as a substitute for rice and pasta. Others loved it because it's naturally gluten free, filling and contains a ton of nutrients.The quinoa boom has died out slightly, but it remains a staple in the kitchens of health nuts everywhere.So what do you need to know about quinoa?Quinoa is a flowering plant first discovered 3,000-4,000 years ago in the Andean region of South America. The seeds of the plant are the small, round, tan-brown grains you may be familiar with by this point. When the plant is harvested, the seeds are processed to remove a bitter-tasting outer covering. Whether quinoa is better for you than rice depends on the kind of rice you're comparing it to. Quinoa and brown rice have similar nutritional values, according to the SF Gate. They are almost equally low in calories and offer a similar number of grams of carbohydrates. Where they differ is in the amount of dietary fiber and protein they contain. Quinoa has slightly more dietary fiber and protein than brown rice. Quinoa is also considered a better source of iron and magnesium, among other vitamins. Most people turned to quinoa for the health benefits. It's been hailed as the 'supergrain of the future', by the Quinoa Corporation because of the many vitamins, minerals and other things packed into each serving. The fiber in quinoa, for example, can assist with bowel movements, reducing high blood pressure and symptoms of diabetes. It may also help to keep you fuller longer and give you energy throughout the day. Iron, which is found in quinoa, helps to keep red blood cells functioning as they should be. It's also essential for the creation of hemoglobin. Iron carries oxygen to the cells and muscles in the body. It's known to be useful in the regulation of body temperature and help with enzyme activity and energy levels. Quinoa contains lysine, which is necessary for the repair and growth of body tissue; magnesium, which helps relax blood cells, may help alleviate some Type Two Diabetes symptoms and is necessary for keeping bones and teeth healthy; riboflavin, or B2, which helps keep energy up within the brain and muscles; and manganese, which is an antioxidant that helps prevent damage to the mitochondria during energy production.A single cup of cooked quinoa contains 222 calories, according to Time. One cup of cooked quinoa contains 8.14 grams of protein, 3.4 grams of fat, 222 calories, 15 per cent of the recommended daily intake of iron, five grams of fiber and 118 mg or magnesium, 39.41 grams of carbohydrates, 31 mg of calcium, 2.76 mg of iron, 318 mg of potassium, 13 mg of sodium and 2.02 mg of zinc.Before cooking quinoa, the grain should be measured, rinsed and strained. Keep in mind, one cup of dried quinoa will yield about three cups when cooked. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a saucepan, then add your strained quinoa to the pan to toast for about one minute.Add water or broth to the saucepan. If you're cooking one cup of quinoa, you'll need between one and a half and two cups of liquid. At this point, you can add salt and any other spices you'd like to the quinoa. Bring the liquid to a boil before lowering the heat and covering your quinoa. Leave it be for 15 minutes, at which time you should remove the quinoa from the heat and let it stand for five minutes. Remove the lid, fluff your quinoa with a fork and serve. Your quinoa should now have small spiral-like tails curling around the seeds. If there's still a significant amount of liquid in the pan or your quinoa feels crunchy, return to the burner and cook covered for a few more minutes.

Who is Xi Jinping? Here’s everything you need to know about who China's leader is and what else the country’s government has banned.On February 5, the ruling Chinese Communist Party made the surprise announcement of an amendment to the country’s constitution abolishing term limits for the presidency. Previously, the country’s leaders had been restricted to two terms.The move immediately sparked a backlash both in China and abroad, compelling the government to take action quickly to stifle any dissenters.The Chinese government swiftly took action to crack down on any criticism by censoring the country’s social media platforms like Weibo. In Chinese slang, Chinese characters can be used along with the English letter ‘n’ to indicate when someone did something ‘many’ times. Thus, China’s censors were able to thwart any criticism of Xi by banning any disagreement with his ‘n’ terms as president and the like.The ban was temporary, as the China Digital Times reported that the letter could be in use again the following day.Xi Jinping is the current President of the People’s Republic of China and General Secretary of the nation’s ruling Communist Party.Xi was born on June 15, 1953 in Beijing.His father, Xi Zhongxun, was one of the early leaders in Communist China. Xi joined the Communist Party of China in 1974 and steadily rose through the party ranks. He served as governor of Fujian province from 1999 to 2002 and as governor and party secretary of Zhejiang province from 2002 to 2007. He ascended to the party’s senior leadership in 2007 and served as the vice president of the country from 2008 to 2013. Xi ultimately succeeded Hu Jintao as president on March 14, 2013.Xi has made a number of sweeping reforms since taking power, fighting corruption and strengthening the country’s economy and legal system but also cracking down on digital dissent. Like Mao Zedong, Xi has built a strong cult of personality around him and has strived to present himself as an ordinary ‘man of the people.’Weibo, officially Sina Weibo, is a popular social media site used by 392 million monthly users in China.The platform was launched on August 14, 2009 by Sina Corp.Although Weibo provides a public platform for discussion in China, it’s also censored heavily by the Chinese government, which bans using it as a platform for political dissent.In addition to the letter ‘n,’ the Chinese government has censored a number of other words and phrases in its recent crackdown.Banned search and post terms also include Animal Farm and 1984, two of novelist George Orwell’s most prominent works. The word emigrate was also banned, as the China Daily Times reported that searches for it on the Chinese search engine Baidu surged following the controversial announcement.The government has also blocked Winnie the Pooh images, as critics of Xi have used it to mock him since his ascendance to power in 2013.
969315240159653888	2018-03-01 20:55:36	https://t.co/nNFuIqhsT5	Exiled former president of Catalonia renounces bid to lead the region again https://t.co/nNFuIqhsT5	Catalonia's deposed leader Carles Puigdemont said today he has abandoned his bid to return as regional president.He made the statement in an attempt to unblock a political impasse as the region remains without a fully functioning government.'I will not put myself forward as candidate to be appointed regional president,' Puigdemont, who is in self-exile in Belgium and wanted in Spain for his role in the failed secession bid, said in a video posted on social media.In his filmed speech, Puigdemont said he was renouncing his bid to lead Catalonia again so that the region currently under direct Madrid rule could get a new government.'We won't surrender, we won't give up,' he said, adding he would work to bring international attention on the independence cause.'I know that the path we have ahead is long and fraught with difficulties.' The 55-year-old former journalist called for a new round of talks to take place 'as soon as possible' to choose a new candidate, and put forward Jordi Sanchez, the head of the ANC, a hugely influential pro-independence citizens' group.Sanchez, however, has been in prison for more than four months, charged with sedition over his role in the secession attempt which culminated on October 27 when separatist lawmakers declared independence.The Spanish government moved in immediately, stripping Catalonia of its prized autonomy, sacking its regional government, dissolving its parliament and calling snap elections on December 21.Puigdemont left for Belgium shortly after but still ran in the polls from abroad, leading the separatist bloc to victory as they retained their absolute majority in parliament.As such, he was the separatists' favoured candidate to lead Catalonia again, arguing he could govern the region remotely.But Spain's Constitutional Court made his appointment conditional on his physical presence in the regional capital Barcelona, with permission from a judge.At the end of January, the Catalan parliament's speaker - also a separatist - postponed a key vote to reappoint him as president.Since then, separatist parties had been locked in talks as to how to go forward.Suggestions had started to emerge that Puigdemont could be given a 'symbolic' role in Belgium while another candidate would be picked to lead Catalonia from Barcelona.Today, Catalonia's majority separatist parliament approved a motion defending him as the 'legitimate' candidate for the regional presidency - a move widely seen as a way to encourage him to step aside without losing face.The motion also stated that the separatists were 'favourable to the constitution of Catalonia as an independent state', but stopped short of validating the failed declaration of independence. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said today that a Catalan leader 'must be chosen now who is in Spain, who is not in jail and who has no problems with the law'.
969311360726249477	2018-03-01 20:40:11	https://t.co/xkZ3NrlB0b	Vapers are more likely to get pneumonia, study finds - as evidence mounts that e-cigarettes are not 'risk free' https://t.co/xkZ3NrlB0b	People who smoke e-cigarettes have an increased risk of developing pneumonia, a new study warns. After collecting data from 17 vapers, researchers found that bacteria that cause the lung infection stick to cells lining their airways more easily than they do in non-e-cigarette users.Traditional cigarettes have long been linked to an increased risk of pneumonia, but it has been less clear whether e-cigarettes might have the same effect. The study, conducted by researchers from the Queen Mary University of London, provides more insight to the harmful effects vaping can have on lungs.Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can cause mild to severe illness in people of all ages, kills about 50,000 people each year in the US. For the study, researchers led by Dr Jonathan Grigg, a professor of pediatric respiratory and environmental medicine, asked 17 people who vaped regularly to smoke an e-cigarette in the lab.They found that vaping increased levels of a molecule produced by airway-lining cells, called platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) - a substance that makes pneumonia-causing bacteria stick to airways.When researchers compared participant's PAFR levels before and after the vaping session, they found a three-fold increase in these molecules an hour after they vaped.Then, the researchers exposed mice to e-cigarette vapor and found higher PAFR production in the rodents that inhaled the fumes.PAFR levels surged in human nose lining cells in culture dishes exposed to e-liquids with nicotine and in cells exposed to nicotine-free vapor. This lead to an increase in pneumonia-causing bacteria adhering to the those cells. 'The take-home message is that it is over-optimistic to assume that all of the adverse effects of cigarette smoking are reduced by switching to vaping,' said Dr Grigg.'It also raises the question that, even if we have not proved that vaping increases the risk of pneumonia, for young people taking up vaping for the first time, a precautionary approach would suggest that the risk should be assumed to exist until proved otherwise,' he added. This isn't the first study to reveal vaping can negatively impact the lungs.A 2017 study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine found e-cigarettes can trigger immune responses in the lung that can contribute to inflammatory lung diseases.Previous studies have also linked e-cigarettes to adverse health effects.Research published earlier this year by scientists at the University of Rochester found that vaping flavors are toxic to white blood cells and can increase the risk of developing life-threatening diseases.A 2018 study conducted by researchers at New York University revealed e-cigarettes can cause DNA mutations that can lead to cancer. Researchers of the current study said that even though their results must be verified in larger human trials, the findings still suggest that e-cigarettes aren't risk-free and shouldn't necessarily be considered a safe way for people to try to curb use of traditional cigarettes, the researchers conclude in the European Respiratory Journal.When it comes to pneumonia, researchers said nicotine patches or gum may be a safer option for smoking cessation.

Heartwarming moment a baby chimpanzee co-pilots his flight home after being rescued from poachers https://t.co/UCx56axnRL	This is the heartwarming moment a baby chimpanzee co-piloted his own rescue mission.Mussa bonded with his rescuer during their flight home together after he saved him from poachers in the Congo.The little ape reaches down to touch the controls during the adorable clip which was taken during their flight.Virunga National park pilot Anthony Caere sat Mussa on his knee in a touching video which has been viewed more than 23,000 times.Mussa looks completely relaxed as he nods off during their journey.The pilot even plays father to the chimp and picks at the baby's fur in a parental fashion. The chimp is being treated for intestinal parasites, but conservationists say he is now 'playing and laughing' since his rescue.Caere wrote on Instagram: 'Great teamwork of @lwirocrpl (Lwiro Primates) and Virunga National Park to save this baby out of the hands of poachers. 'We flew baby Mussa to his new home at Lwiro Primates. This looks cute but is actually a sad story. He should be with his mum... But happy we could give him a new good home! 'Thanks to the whole team! This is conservation!'He will be rehomed at the Lwiro Primates rescue and rehabilitation center. Alongside the photos and video on Facebook, Lwiro Primates wrote: 'Every rescue is an effort from a lot of people from different organisations who work together to save lives.'It is a beautiful moment to see the result of everybody's implication, in this case we save the life of Mussa...'Rescues are always a mix of feelings... happy because we are saving them but sad at the same time for what it means for wild populations.'
969295707877371905	2018-03-01 19:38:00	https://t.co/v6xZezkxMt	Social media giants are told they must remove terror content within an hour or be punished under new EU laws https://t.co/v6xZezkxMt	The EU has told Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies they must take down 'terrorist content' within an hour of it being reported or else laws will be created to force them to do so. Several governments have increased pressure on social media companies to do more to remove illegal content, including material related to ISIS and the incitement to commit atrocities.The sector has increased efforts to demonstrate its progress.But in its strongest call yet to the technology sector, the European Commission today recommended measures that internet platforms should take to stop the proliferation of extremist content.The recommendations include the removal of such material within an hour of being notified of its existence.European governments have said that extremist content on the web has influenced lone-wolf attackers who have killed people in several European cities after being radicalised.'While several platforms have been removing more illegal content than ever before... we still need to react faster against terrorist propaganda and other illegal content,' Digital Commissioner Andrus Ansip said.This content remains 'a serious threat to our citizens' security, safety and fundamental rights,' added Ansip, a former Estonian prime minister. European online trade association EDiMA, whose members include Google, Facebook and Twitter, said it was dismayed the Commission had not first chosen to engage in dialogue. A one-hour turn-around time might also not be workable, it said.The recommendation, which is non-binding but could be taken into account by European courts, sets guidelines on how companies should remove illegal content generally - from copyright infringements to hate speech - and advises a quicker reaction to extremist material.The Commission said it would assess the need for legislation within three months for what it described as 'terrorist content', given the urgency of the issue. For all other types of illegal content it will assess progress made within six months.It also called on the technology sector, which is dominated by American companies, to adopt proactive measures such as automated detection to rid their platforms of illegal content.Campaign group the Counter Extremism Project said the Commission's proposal was welcome but did not tackle two issues - how to make automated technology widely available and how to stop extremists uploading again content that had been removed.European Digital Rights, a civil rights group, described the Commission's approach as putting internet giants in charge of censoring Europe. Only legislation would ensure democratic scrutiny and judicial review.Luxury groups, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission's move saying action by online platforms is also necessary to fight the sale of counterfeit goods online.'Proactive measures coupled with good consumer information is the only way to effectively deal with illegal content online,' said Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH. Last month the Commission said IT firms removed 70 per cent of illegal content notified to them in the preceding few months.This was compared to 59 per cent before May 2017, and 28 per cent in the months after the code of conduct was launched in 2016. 
969290844430848004	2018-03-01 19:18:40	https://t.co/jtOHTsQ4r3	Ghana school master uses a blackboard to demonstrate IT skills and now Microsoft have promised him free equipment https://t.co/jtOHTsQ4r3	A teacher from Ghana has received worldwide praise after a photo of him teaching students how to use Microsoft Word on a blackboard went viral. Because there are no computers at the middle school where he works he uses coloured chalk painstakingly to draw a version of the computer screen onto the blackboard.In mid-February, he shared a Facebook post showing photos of his 'needs must' method of teaching. 'Teaching of ICT in Ghana's school is very funny,' Owura Kwadwo - better known as Richard Appiah Akoto - said in a Facebook post alongside the photos.'I love my students so have to do what will make them understand what [I] am teaching.' The information and computer technology (ICT) teacher has subsequently been contacted by Microsoft after the images were shared thousands of times online. The company has promised to send him new computer equipment and give him access to its 'professional development resources'. Akto for the past six years has taught at Betenase M/A Junior High School, about three hours north of the second largest Ghanaian city of Kumasi.The school does not have any computers even though in recent years 14 and 15-year-olds are expected to write and pass a national exam, with ICT being one of the subjects.'This is not my first time [of drawing] it. I have been doing it anytime I am in the classroom,' Akoto told Quartz Africa.'I like posting pictures on Facebook so I just felt like [sharing it]. I didn't know it would get the attention of people like that,' he said. His story was brought to the attention of Microsoft by entrepreneur Rebecca Enonchong who tweeted the company to point that he was teaching the use of their product without having physical access to it.'Surely you can get him some proper resources,' she suggested.On Tuesday, the software giant acted on her request. Quartz subsequently pointed out that Akoto's situation typifies an 'under-resourced dysfunctional public school system'.It said that many economically disadvantaged families throughout Africa 'are forced to choose private schools over free public primary schools' due to a lack of resources. In Ghana, there have been calls for more resources to help rural schools like Betenase which 'struggles with teaching logistics challenges'.
969286163507957760	2018-03-01 19:00:04	https://t.co/QjfNnrdEHu	Scientists 'map' depression in the brain - offering hope for better ways to diagnose and treat the disorder https://t.co/QjfNnrdEHu	Scientists may soon be able to predict depression by examining the way that different parts of the brain talk to each other, new research suggests.Researchers at Duke University made a map of activity in the brains of mice, and found that some patterns were associated with depression.Currently, depression is mostly diagnosed based on subjective questions and, in some cases, blood tests for thyroid conditions that may cause some cases of the mood disorder.If their 'map' of brain activity translates to humans, the researchers believe their findings could one day be used to diagnose and even prevent depression.For more than 30 years, scientists and doctors have watched and compared activities in various regions of the brains of both people who seem to be more susceptible to depressive symptoms and those who appear more resilient in the face of stressors.But by using methods of monitoring how different parts of the brain are working in sync developed in the last decade, researchers like Duke's Dr Kafui Dziarasa and Dr Miguel Nicolelis have come a step closer to a full picture of how the brains of people struggling with different mental illnesses behave.'You can think of different brain regions as individual instruments in an orchestra,' Dzirasa said. 'We are interested in not just what each instrument is doing, but how the instruments coordinate themselves to generate music.To simulate depression in the mice they studied, they had each animal in there study spend 10 days living with a bigger, more aggressive mouse.The stress resulted in symptoms not unlike the behaviors of depressed humans in some – but not all – of the mice.This was key to the experiment, as the researchers wanted to see what distinguished the brains of mice (and eventually people) that could handle the stress and those that could not.In order to understand this, they monitored the electrical activity – the language different parts of the brain speak to one another – of seven different regions.This allowed the team of scientists to map the 'music' each brain was playing, and how what distinguished a depressed tune from a more resilient one.They found clear differences between the activity patterns in the mice that handled the stress well and those that suffered the way someone prone to depression might.Depression is difficult to treat, and many people may struggle against the mood disorder for decades.One of the most effective – but dangerous – treatments for it has been electroconvulsive, or 'shock,' therapy, which works because the sort of seizure it causes seems to quickly rewire the brain, resetting the chemical imbalance seen in those with depression.Despite measures to make it safer, the procedure is still stigmatized and carries risks that it could damage the brain and cause serious heart problems.But, with a more complete understanding of the electoral activity in the brains of depressed people, 'it might be possible to target electricity to the right place in the right way to create a treatment that doesn't have the same side-effects as putting electricity everywhere,' said Dr Dzirasa.A mental map of a depressed brain could also help reconcile psychological and physical components of depression and lead to more comprehensive and effective preventative measures and treatments.
969278115611594752	2018-03-01 18:28:05	https://t.co/BAo0025xxm	North Atlantic right whales are on the brink of extinction as scientists fear no calves were born this year https://t.co/BAo0025xxm	 North Atlantic right whales may be on the brink of extinction. Today, there are only 450 of these majestic creatures left in the world, and this year, no new calves were born. At least 17 of the creatures died last year - a record death toll - with most of them dying after becoming tangled in fishing equipment. Now scientists say the creatures are facing an 'unprecedented calamity' as their numbers continue to fall. The whales reproduce between November and February every year and, on average, 17 calves are born. But last year, this number dropped to 5, and this year there were none. Of the animals that are currently alive, only 100 are females of reproductive age. 'At the rate we are killing them off, this 100 females will be gone in 20 years,' said Mark Baumgartner, a marine ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. Charles Mayo, director of the Right Whale Ecology Program at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts said that if there really are no babies found, it would be 'unprecedented'. 'I think we're in a helluva pickle,' he told the New York Times. North Atlantic right whales can live up to 70 years old in captivity, but many are perishing long before they reach that age. The main culprit for the vast amount of deaths is the commercial fishing industry. Crab and lobster trapping is coomonplace throughout the oceans of Canada and New England. At 60 feet long, these behemoths can easily become entangled in the ropes and many never succeed in freeing themselves. Another major problem for the species is that every year, several are killed by ships. Shipping lanes mean that not only are whales at risk of collision, but calves can become separated from their mothers. A ten-year old female was killed in January by fishing gear. Although the first death of 2018, this tragedy follows a year when 18 of the animals were found dead. Federal research suggests 82 per cent of premature deaths are from animals getting trapped in fishing line. 'Lobster and crab fishing and whales are able to comfortably co-exist,' Dr Baumgartner said. 'We are trying to propose solutions, it's urgent.' North Atlantic right whales are a species of marine mammal which can measure up to 60 feet long (20 metres). They can weigh up to 70 tons (64 tonnes) and eat around 5,500 pounds (2,500 kg) every single day. They tend to calve off the shores of Georgia and Florida in the Atlantic Ocean before migrating further north. Numbers have plummeted in recent years due to premature deaths as a result of getting trapped in fishing lines and unfortunate encounters with ships. A primnciple food source for the whales is phytoplankton. This phytoplankton has been damaged in recent times as global warming has increased the water temperature of the Gulf of Maine. It is currently critically endangered and there are believed to be only 450 animals i nthe world., Of these, only 100 are reproductive age females, and at the current rate they are being killed (18 last year) the species could be functionally extinct in 20 years. The animals has a gestation period of over a year and the calves rely on their mother for food for a further 9-12 months.

Outbursts from supermassive black holes strip away layers of thick atmosphere from 'mini-Neptune' gas giants toreveal their rocky centre, dubbed super-Earths. Experts have previously suggested that these celestial bodies, around ten times larger than our own planet, could support the building blocks of life. Scroll down for video Planetary scientists from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics examined the environment around the closest supermassive black hole to Earth. Supermassive black holes are found at the centre of every known massive galaxy, shaping the matter that surrounds them. Sagittarius A*, which lies at the heart of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is four million times larger than the sun. Researchers think that the impact of this black hole may be one of the most common ways for rocky super-Earths to form close to the centre of our galaxy. Some of these planets will be located in the habitable, or 'Goldilocks', zone of stars like the sun. In a written statement Howard Chen, of Northwestern University in Illinois, who led the study, said: 'It’s pretty wild to think of black holes shaping the evolutionary destiny of a planet, but that very well may be the case in the center of our galaxy. It is well known that material falling into the black hole in occasional feeding frenzies will generate bright flares of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. X-ray telescopes such as Nasa’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA’s XMM-Newton have seen evidence for bright outbursts generated in the past, ranging from about six million years to just over a century ago. The authors considered the effects of this high-energy radiation on planets within 70 light-years of the black hole that have masses in between Earth and Neptune’s. They found that X-ray and ultraviolet radiation would blast away a large amount of the thick gas of such planets near the black hole. In some cases this would leave behind a bare, rocky core. Whether or not life is likely to arise on such planets is a matter of some debate. The super-Earths in this particular study would be buffeted by supernova explosions and gamma ray bursts, which might damage the chemistry of any atmosphere remaining on the planets. In astronomy and astrobiology, the habitable zone is the range of orbits around a star in which a planet can support liquid water. This habitable zone is also known as the ‘Goldilocks’ zone, taken from the children’s fairy tale. The temperature from the star needs to be 'just right' so that liquid water can exist on the surface. The boundaries of the habitable zone are critical. If a planet is too close to its star, it will experience a runaway greenhouse gas effect, like Venus. But if it's too far, any water will freeze, as is seen on Mars. Since the concept was first presented in 1953, many stars have been shown to have a Goldilocks area, and some of them have one or several planets in this zone, like 'Kepler-186f', discovered in 2014. Additional outbursts from the supermassive black hole could provide a knockout punch and completely erode a planet’s atmosphere. These planets would also be subjected to the gravitational disruptions of a passing star that could fling the planet away from its life-sustaining host. Such encounters might occur frequently near the Milky Way’s supermassive black hole since the region is so packed with stars. Within about 70 light-years of the centre of the galaxy, astronomers think the average separation between rocky worlds is between about 46 and 470 billion miles (75 and 750 bn km). By comparison, the nearest star to the solar system is 25 billion miles (40,000 bn km) away. Away from the influence of these massive black holes, however, life could find a way to flourish on such planets. In December 2017, scientists detected a new ‘super-Earth’ planet just 21 light-years away, which they said could be habitable. The planet is roughly three times more massive than Earth, and is thought to be a rocky world that may be cool enough to sustain liquid water. It orbits along the inner edge of an M-dwarf star’s habitable zone. There are formidable challenges required to directly detect such planets. The distance to the Galactic Center (26,000 light years from Earth), the crowded region, and the blocking of light by intervening dust and gas all make it hard to observe such planets. These challenges may be met by the next generation of extraordinarily large ground-based telescopes. For example, searches for transits with future observatories like the European Extremely Large Telescope might detect evidence for these planets. Another possibility is searching for stars with unusual patterns of elements in their atmosphere that have migrated away from the centre of the galaxy. The full findings of the study were published on the academic pre-print archive Arxiv. Black holes are so dense and their gravitational pull is so strong that no form of radiation can escape them - not even light. They act as intense sources of gravity which hoover up dust and gas around them. Their intense gravitational pull is thought to be what stars in galaxies orbit around. How they are formed is still poorly understood. Astronomers believe they may form when a large cloud of gas up to 100,000 times bigger than the sun, collapses into a black hole. Many of these black hole seeds then merge to form much larger supermassive black holes, which are found at the centre of every known massive galaxy. Alternatively, a supermassive black hole seed could come from a giant star, about 100 times the sun's mass, that ultimately forms into a black hole after it runs out of fuel and collapses. When these giant stars die, they also go 'supernova', a huge explosion that expels the matter from the outer layers of the star into deep space. 
969275969465978880	2018-03-01 18:19:34	https://t.co/WHOBCE9Q6D	North Atlantic right whales are on the brink of extinction as scientists fear no calves were born this year https://t.co/WHOBCE9Q6D	 North Atlantic right whales may be on the brink of extinction. Today, there are only 450 of these majestic creatures left in the world, and this year, no new calves were born. At least 17 of the creatures died last year - a record death toll - with most of them dying after becoming tangled in fishing equipment. Now scientists say the creatures are facing an 'unprecedented calamity' as their numbers continue to fall. The whales reproduce between November and February every year and, on average, 17 calves are born. But last year, this number dropped to 5, and this year there were none. Of the animals that are currently alive, only 100 are females of reproductive age. 'At the rate we are killing them off, this 100 females will be gone in 20 years,' said Mark Baumgartner, a marine ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. Charles Mayo, director of the Right Whale Ecology Program at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts said that if there really are no babies found, it would be 'unprecedented'. 'I think we're in a helluva pickle,' he told the New York Times. North Atlantic right whales can live up to 70 years old in captivity, but many are perishing long before they reach that age. The main culprit for the vast amount of deaths is the commercial fishing industry. Crab and lobster trapping is coomonplace throughout the oceans of Canada and New England. At 60 feet long, these behemoths can easily become entangled in the ropes and many never succeed in freeing themselves. Another major problem for the species is that every year, several are killed by ships. Shipping lanes mean that not only are whales at risk of collision, but calves can become separated from their mothers. A ten-year old female was killed in January by fishing gear. Although the first death of 2018, this tragedy follows a year when 18 of the animals were found dead. Federal research suggests 82 per cent of premature deaths are from animals getting trapped in fishing line. 'Lobster and crab fishing and whales are able to comfortably co-exist,' Dr Baumgartner said. 'We are trying to propose solutions, it's urgent.' North Atlantic right whales are a species of marine mammal which can measure up to 60 feet long (20 metres). They can weigh up to 70 tons (64 tonnes) and eat around 5,500 pounds (2,500 kg) every single day. They tend to calve off the shores of Georgia and Florida in the Atlantic Ocean before migrating further north. Numbers have plummeted in recent years due to premature deaths as a result of getting trapped in fishing lines and unfortunate encounters with ships. A primnciple food source for the whales is phytoplankton. This phytoplankton has been damaged in recent times as global warming has increased the water temperature of the Gulf of Maine. It is currently critically endangered and there are believed to be only 450 animals i nthe world., Of these, only 100 are reproductive age females, and at the current rate they are being killed (18 last year) the species could be functionally extinct in 20 years. The animals has a gestation period of over a year and the calves rely on their mother for food for a further 9-12 months. 
969271111572652032	2018-03-01 18:00:15	https://t.co/DEef0RlKDJ	Selfies make noses look BIGGER than they are - and more people are getting surgery to change the way they look https://t.co/DEef0RlKDJ	 Selfies may motivate people to get nose jobs, new research claims. Researchers said this is because the short distance between the face and the camera makes nose look 30 percent larger than normal. Furthermore, 42 percent of plastic surgeons say people opt for nose jobs to improve how they look on Facebook and Twitter. The study, led by researchers at Rutgers University, shows for the first time the extraordinary extent to which close up images alters a person's central facial feature. Researcher Dr Boris Paskhover, facial plastics & reconstructive surgeon, told Daily Mail Online these findings aren't surprising. 'People have to be aware that selfies change how your face looks,' Dr Paskhover said. 'I notice a lot of my patients come in and show me selfies of what they looks like,' he said. 'And I have to tell them that those selfies aren't accurate.' For the study, Dr Paskhover and his colleagues developed a mathematical model to help describe how much selfie cameras distort the face. His team's facial model was based on data collected from a random sample of racially and ethnically diverse participants across the US. They then used the average length and width of noses and heads to determine the perceived change in nose breadth in both males and females at a selfie distance of 12 inches, five feet and infinity. They found that when taken 12 inches away, selfies increase nose sizes by 30 percent in men and 29 percent in women compared to photos taken five feet away, a standard portrait distance. 'When the camera's close to the face it makes the nose look larger in proportion,' Dr Paskhover said. 'This may motivate people to seek cosmetic surgery,' he added. Researchers said selfies have rapidly become one of the major photographic modalities of in recent years. In 2014 alone there were over 93 billion selfies taken on Android phones per day. Research published in 2014 by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery revealed that one in three facial plastic surgeons saw an increase in requests for procedures due to patients being more self aware of looks in social media. There's recently been an uptick in cosmetic surgery in recent years, with men and women spending $16 billion to adjust their appearance in 2016 alone. Dr Thomas Sterry, a board-certified plastic surgeon, told Daily Mail Online that increase can be attributed to camera phones and social media 'I do a lot of cases now that I wouldn’t have a few years ago, only because patients are more aware of what they look like to the public,' said Dr Sterry, who was not involved with the study. 'Selfies are abundant and everyone seems to be taking them,' he added. Dr Paskhover said more research is needed on this topic. 'Further studies are necessary to determine whether patients who take frequent selfies are less satisfied with their clinical outcomes and if this distortion informs future medical decisions,' he said. The current study published in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery followed the AAFPRS survey last year that found 99 percent of US surgeons believe celebrity and social media is driving a desire for the perfect selfie. 
969268804764274688	2018-03-01 17:51:05	https://t.co/3gizfWiJSM	French lawmakers submit proposals to fine men £80 for commenting on a woman's looks in public https://t.co/3gizfWiJSM	 French MPs are calling for a fine of at least €90 (£80) for people caught making sexist catcalls as President Emmanuel Macron's government targets sexual violence and harassment. The group of five MPs submitted proposals to the government including a fine for 'comments, behaviour or pressure of a sexist or sexual character' that is degrading, humiliating, intimidating, hostile or offensive. The new proposals put forward to the government are aimed at combatting the levels of harassment rife on the streets of the country's cities. Politicians have been putting their heads together for a report on how to tackle the issue and define what constitutes 'sexual outrage', according to The Local. This has been the foundation of the plans drawn up to eradicate what is described as everyday sexism in France. It had been suggested wolf-whistling would be punishable with on-the-spot fines, but the new report makes no reference to it. However the planned measures want to give authorities the power to dish out penalties to those who follow women down the street, block their paths or make lout and lewd comments regarding their physique or the way they look. The issue is heightened on public transport in major cities, with women opting to wear trousers instead of skirts for fear of being groped. Since the new law has been discussed, a stream of women have come forward to say how they have been sexually assaulted in shops, on the metro and on the streets of Paris. The £80 (€90) fine is said to increase to £120 if it is not paid within two weeks and could increase further to £325 if payment is late. It is the brainchild of France's Secretary of State for Equality Marlene Schiappa, who lobbied for what she described as the everyday sexism in France to be addressed. The bill is expected to be presented to parliament next week after she and two other ministers - Minister of Justice, Nicole Belloubet, and Minister of the Interior, Gerard Collomb - cast their eyes over the final draft. 
969266279864561665	2018-03-01 17:41:03	https://t.co/YXA5Rb7DCa	South African president vows to settle the transfer of land from white to black owners https://t.co/YXA5Rb7DCa	 South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said he wants the issue of the transfer of land from white to black owners to be resolved 'once and for all'. The nation moved to hasten the transfer on Tuesday when parliament backed a motion seeking to change the constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation. The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long promised reforms to redress racial disparities in land ownership and the subject remains highly emotive more than two decades after the end of apartheid. Ramaphosa said after his inauguration two weeks ago that he would speed up the transfer of land to black people, although he stressed that food production and security must be preserved. 'I will shortly initiate a dialogue with key stakeholders. There is no need for any one of us to panic and start beating war drums,' Ramaphosa said in parliament. 'We are going to address this and make sure that we come up with resolutions that resolve this once and for all. 'This original sin that was committed when our country was colonised must be resolved in a way that will take South Africa forward.' Whites still own most of South Africa's land following centuries of brutal colonial dispossession. White farmers control 73 percent of arable land compared with 85 percent, when the apartheid system ended in 1994. Civil rights group AfriForum has said it will launch an international campaign to inform governments and foreign investors 'that property rights in South Africa are being threatened'. AfriForum, an organisation that mostly represents white South Africans on issues like affirmative action, said foreign investments in South Africa will also not be safe should plans for land expropriation without compensation go ahead. Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, said land expropriation 'could unleash conflict in the country'. He said AfriForum will lobby South African trade partners and ask countries whose citizens own land in the country to put pressure on Pretoria to stop the process of land expropriation. The ruling ANC adopted a policy at its conference in December to redress racial ownership disparities by expropriating land without compensation, pledging to do so in way that does not undermine food security in the country, Africa's top maize producer. Neighbouring Zimbabwe's often-violent land reform programme started in 2000, with thousands of farmers forced off their land by mobs or evicted. President Robert Mugabe said the reforms would help black people impoverished by British colonial rule. But critics blame the land redistribution for the collapse in agricultural production that led to Zimbabwe's economy being wrecked by hyper-inflation, mass unemployment and emigration.

The extent of the horrific crime in Madhya Pradesh was only uncovered after police officers took the victim's body to be examined. A post-mortem discovered the child had been beaten up, strangled, stabbed, had her eyeballs gouged out and her throat slit. Her distraught family have claimed the murderer only killed their loved one because he failed to rape her, according to the Daily Bhaskar. It is thought the girl managed to fight off the sexual assault, but died after her killer attacked her with what is described as a 'shard weapon'. She was left to die in a field, and when police arrived at the scene of the crime a crowd had gathered. The details of the murder spread through the local community and the brutality of the crime saw people rush to the field. Police had to ask the locals to leave while they wrapped the child in blankets in order to cover the gruesome injuries. She was taken to the Panna district hospital for her post-mortem and investigators are still working on finding the killer.

969249459346509824	2018-03-01 16:34:13	https://t.co/bCgap95yPQ	Optimists are more likely to survive health threats, finds study https://t.co/bCgap95yPQ	 Looking on the bright side of life can help people survive health threats, research suggests. A study of people with 2,400 people with angina - a heart problem that causes severe chest pain - found those with an optimistic outlook were 30 per cent less likely to require hospital treatment over nearly two years of monitoring. Scientists are increasingly interested in the impact someone’s attitude and outlook can have on their health. For decades medical research has focused on physical symptoms and developing drugs and procedures to deal with them. But a growing body of evidence suggests that mood, which has largely been ignored by doctors, could have a major impact on a patient’s chance of recovery. The researchers, from Duke University in North Carolina and Columbia University in New York, asked the patients after one month, six months and 12 months how optimistic they were about the future. Levels of optimism stayed roughly the same at each interview - with a quarter ‘most optimistic’, about two fifths ‘optimistic’, a fifth neutral and a tenth not optimistic. The researchers found for every degree of optimism, the chances of being taken into hospital within the two-year study period dropped. Those who were the most optimistic were about 40 per cent less likely than those who were not optimistic to require hospital. The researchers said this was partly because the optimistic people had better health to start with. But even when they adjusted their results to take this into account, they found there was still a 30 per cent gap between the most optimistic and the least. Study leader Dr Alexander Fanaroff of Duke University Medical Centre said: ‘Feeling better about your disease process and ability to reengage in usual activities may actually make chronic angina easier to deal with. ‘Our findings suggest that if we can identify patients who are less optimistic for whatever reason-whether it’s because their disease has made them despair for the future, they have uncertainty about their diagnosis, or they have multiple comorbidities-and help them feel more hopeful by focusing on what they can do, we may be able to positively affect outcomes.’ Having a more positive outlook on life may help people live longer. A study in 2016 revealed that women who are optimistic are less likely to die from cancer, heart disease, stroke, infection, and several other major causes of death. The positive health effects for the women were shown to last more than eight years. The Harvard University researchers suggested that public health professionals should begin pushing positivity in patients alongside a healthy diet and exercise. The study analysed data from 2004-2012 from 70,000 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. This long-running study has biannually tracked women's health via surveys for 40 years. The team looked at participants' levels of optimism alongside other factors that might play a role in mortality risk, such as race, high blood pressure, diet, and physical activity. Other studies published in the last two years have found similar results for cancer, stroke, respiratory disease and infection. Scientists suspect this may be because someone’s general mood alters the levels of harmful and beneficial hormones in their body. Being optimistic, for example, reduces stress and anxiety hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which can place a burden on the heart and raise blood pressure. Studies have also found people who are less stressed have lower cholesterol levels, are less prone to inflammation, have a better immune response and higher levels of antioxidants in the blood. People who are less optimistic and more stressed are also more likely to smoke and drink to unhealthy levels. But Dr Fanaroff, who will present his findings at the American College of Cardiology conference in Orlando later this month, has a more simple explanation. He believes people worried about their health do less exercise because they are overly concerned about the danger. ‘People will often cut back on or stop activities they like to do-tennis, playing with grandchildren, job-related tasks-either because of the pain itself or because they worry that the activity prompting the pain is dangerous to their heart,’ he said. Dr Fanaroff believes reassuring patients and helping them become more confident could have major benefits. ‘As a clinician, it doesn’t cost anything to help patients with chronic angina focus on what they can do, letting them know that there are medications and procedures that can help them return to a normal life and continue to do the things they like to do,’ he said. ‘Bottom line - there’s reason to be optimistic for patients with chronic angina, and it’s important that clinicians relay that to them.’

Ms Parirenyatwa urged local companies to produce condoms that are suitable for their fellow countrymen in a bid to raise the public awareness of HIV, according to news site New Zimbabwe. 'We import condoms from China and some men complain that they are too small,' Ms Parirenyatwa was quoted saying during a recent event in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's Health Minister made the remarks at the launch of the Zimbabwe Private Sector HIV/AIDS and Wellness Coordination Board on February 20. He said: 'The youths now have a particular condom that they like but we don't manufacture them. By encouraging the localisation of condom manufacture, Ms Parirenyatwa hoped to raise the public awareness of preventing HIV among the citizens. The southern part of Africa, where Zimbabwe is situated, has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the world. More than 10 per cent of Zimbabwe's population live with HIV. As of 2016, 1.3 million of its citizens were infected with the virus. According to an interactive map produced in 2016, the average length of an erected penis measures 16.10-17.9 centimetres (6.3-7 inches) in some African countries, such as Ghana, Gabon and Nigeria. The same study found in East Asia, such as South Korea, the measurement ranged between 9.30-10.5 centimetres (3.7-4 inches). In 2013, another African country, Ghana, had to impound more than one million condoms imported from China because the contraceptives were said to be too small and not adequately lubricated.
969240039271133184	2018-03-01 15:56:47	https://t.co/GlNeeoLTkZ	Listening to music while exercising really DOES boost your endurance https://t.co/GlNeeoLTkZ	 Listening to music while exercising really does boost your endurance, researchers have shown. Doctors found people who listened to upbeat music through headphones could run for nearly a minute longer during a tough stress test on a treadmill. The researchers, from Texas Tech University, believe doctors should encourage their patients to listen to music as a way of helping them exercise. They said music acts as a powerful motivator - improving mood and triggering feel-good and energy-boosting chemicals in the brain. The scientists, who are due to present their findings at a major heart conference in Florida later this month, said music could help people stick to exercise routines. Study leader Dr Waseem Shami said: 'At least on a small scale, this study provides some evidence that music may help serve as an extra tool to help motivate someone to exercise more, which is critical to heart health. 'I think it's something we intuitively knew, but we found to be true. I suspect if it had been a larger study, we'd see a bigger difference.' Smiling while running could boost efficiency and help you save energy over long distances, according to a new study. Researchers discovered being happy helped runners consume 2.2 per cent less oxygen than those who showed no emotion. Smiling provided an even bigger boost compared to frowning, the scientists from Ulster and Swansea universities found. Oxygen is often used to measure how much energy runners use, with higher amounts signalling they have used more of their energy. Some 24 club-level runners were involved in the research, published in the journal Psychology of Sport and Exercise. They all had breathing masks attached to them to monitor how much oxygen they used during four six-minute running blocks on a treadmill. During each run, the participants either smiled, frowned, attempted to relax their hands or adopted their normal focus of attention. It is believed that smiling helps runners to relax, which in turn improves their running economy. His team carried out the experiment on 127 people who had been scheduled to carry out a routine electrocardiogram (ECG) treadmill stress test to examine the heart of their heart. During the test, patients are asked to run for as long as they can while hooked up to a heart monitor. Dr Shami's team asked half the patients to wear headphones and listen to fast Latin music, while the other half wore headphones but with no music playing. The patients, who had an average age of 53, ran for eight and a half minutes if they were listening to music - 51 seconds longer than those with no music. Dr Shami, who will present his findings at the American College of Cardiology conference in Orlando later this month, said the tests are very tough because the treadmill speed and incline is increased every three minutes. He said: 'After six minutes, you feel like you are running up a mountain, so even being able to go 50 seconds longer means a lot.' The NHS and World Health Organisation recommend each week people do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise such as cycling, walking or gardening, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise such as running. But very few people hit this target - with polls suggesting 44 per cent of people in Britain do no regular exercise at all. Dr Shami said music could help this. 'Our findings reinforce the idea that upbeat music has a synergistic effect in terms of making you want to exercise longer and stick with a daily exercise routine. 'When doctors are recommending exercise, they might suggest listening to music too.'

As the UK continues to be battered by extreme snow, people may have noticed these freezing temperatures are wreaking havoc on their complexions. Icy downpours and gale-force winds cause the blood vessels in people's skin to rapidly change size to adapt to fluctuating temperatures, which can leave it looking red, flushed and weather beaten. This can be particularly obvious in those with pre-existing skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. The UK is battling extreme snow which has caused temperatures in parts of the country to plummet to as low as -5°C, making this past week the coldest since 1986. Below, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation Trustee Dr Bav Shergill outlines eight ways to keep skin looking in top condition during this unseasonably cold weather. The severe conditions hitting Britain have been described by the Met Office as a 'cocktail of weather events'. The cold spell dubbed the 'the Beast from the East', has been caused by a jump in temperatures high over the Arctic, which is known by meteorologists as 'sudden stratospheric warming'. Temperatures of minus 5C (23F) hit parts of Britain over last weekend, which were the lowest recorded in the week leading up to March 1 - the first day of spring - since 1986. The wind chill, which could see parts of the UK feel as cold as minus 15C (5F), rivals the temperatures forecast for parts of northern Norway and Iceland. The cold weather has been so severe in the Brecon Beacons that an entire waterfall has frozen solid. Walkers in the Welsh national park looked on in fascination as the waterfall near Pen Y Fan mountain was turned into ice amid the cold snap. The wintry blast of freezing temperatures, which is also affecting France, Italy, Spain and Croatia, has already claimed four lives across Europe and is endangering the homeless.

969231073220677634	2018-03-01 15:21:09	https://t.co/owBHWQzifi	Putin reveals new nuclear missiles that cannot be intercepted and can strike almost anywhere in the world https://t.co/owBHWQzifi	 President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia has tested an array of new nuclear weapons 'invulnerable to enemy interception' in a speech where he praised scientists behind the arsenal as 'the heroes of our time'. In his annual state-of-the-nation speech in Moscow, Putin said the weapons include a nuclear-powered cruise missile, a nuclear-powered underwater drone and new hypersonic missile and showed video footage the launch of a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile on big screens. The video footage also contained a computer generated sequence showing the potential power and reach of the new rocket, which included bombs raining down over the U.S. state of Florida. During his speech, Putin said the creation of the new weapons has made NATO's U.S.-led missile defense 'useless,' and means an effective end to what he described as Western efforts to stymie Russia's development. He said: 'I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country's development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened. 'You have failed to contain Russia.' Speaking of the new arsenal, Putin said that the nuclear-powered cruise missile tested last fall has an unlimited range and high speed and maneuverability allowing it to pierce any missile defense. The Russian leader said the high-speed underwater drone also has an 'intercontinental' range and is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that could target both aircraft carriers and coastal facilities. He said its operational depth and high speed would make it immune to enemy intercept, adding: 'It's just fantastic!' Putin added to applause that names for the nuclear-powered cruise missile and the drone haven't yet been chosen, and suggested that the Defense Ministry run a nationwide contest for the best names. The President accompanied his statement to an audience of hundreds of senior officials and lawmakers with videos and computer images of new weapons, which were shown on giant screens at a conference hall near the Kremlin. 'No one in the world has anything like that,' he said. 'It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.' The Russian leader said that another new weapon called Avangard is an intercontinental hypersonic missile that would fly to targets at a speed 20 times the speed of sound and strike 'like a meteorite, like a fireball.' 'This makes it absolutely invincible for any forms of air and missile defence,' he boasted, calling it an 'ideal weapon'. Putin said that Russia also tested a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, called Sarmat, with a range and number of warheads exceeding its Soviet-era predecessor, known in the West as Satan. He praised a new generation of young scientists working on such weaponry, calling them 'the heroes of our time'. The Russian leader emphasized that the development of new weapons that have no equivalent in the West came in response to the U.S. withdrawal from a Cold war-era treaty banning missile defenses and U.S. efforts to develop a missile defense system. He said that the U.S. has ignored Russian complaints. 'No one has listened to us,' he said. 'You listen to us now.' He said the new weapons will help ensure global stability and draw a line under attempts to weaken Russia. He said that another weapons system, called Kinzhal, or Dagger, already has been deployed in Russia's Southern Military District. He said it's a hypersonic missile carried by an aircraft that that flies at 10 times the speed of sound with an unpredictable trajectory towards its target. Today's televised speech was timed to closely precede the March 18 election, in which Putin is set to easily win a fourth term. The Russian leader's approval ratings top 80 per cent despite an economic slowdown caused by continuing tensions with the West and a drop in global oil prices.

The girl, studying in Year 6, was worried that she could not finish her homework before the end of Lunar New Year holiday and decided to commit suicide. She was luckily saved by a safety air cushion that positioned below her. She did not sustain any major injuries but only scratches at her right ear. Footage emerged shows the 12-year-old girl dangerously sitting on a window at a corridor in a building in Fuzhou, Jiangzi Province, on February 24. The girl can be seen plunging from the 14th floor, roughly about 42 metres high (138ft), before firefighters attempted to scale down from the rooftop. She landed on a safety air cushion and was sent to a hospital immediately. She told the firefighters that she had been under a lot of stress during the holiday and she was not able to finish the homework, according to Changsha Evening Post. 'Probably it's because she has not finished her homework yet and she got worried that she could not enroll into some of the classes,' her aunt told the reporters. The 12-year-old luckily survived and only had her right ear injured. Web users commented on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, that students were facing too much pressure from their academic studies. 'It's supposed to be a holiday but teachers love to give students homework. Then what's the meaning of a holiday?' questioned 'fumiaoli'. 'Holiday means school at home, how sad,' said 'jiameimeier'. Another user 'paike+6' suggested the girl's parents to care for their daughter more often. Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.

969223695192477696	2018-03-01 14:51:50	https://t.co/JLqsXzrr5B	Marine Le Pen faces three years in prison after being charged with tweeting ISIS images https://t.co/JLqsXzrr5B	 Marine Le Pen was today facing up to three years in prison after being charged with tweeting 'monstrous' Islamic State images including one of the terrorist group beheading an American journalist. The 49-year-old leader of France's far-Right National Front has denied any wrongdoing, but now faces trial in the Paris suburb of Nanterre. Beyond the three-years in prison, prosecutors can also demand a maximum fine equivalent to £67,000. Ms Le Pen has been charged along with Gilbert Collard, a 70-year-old lawyer and MP with close links to Ms Le Pen's party. A criminal investigation was first launched in December 2015 for the 'diffusion of obscene images', said a prosecuting source in Nanterre. It followed a number of complaints, including one by the parents of American James Foley, who was murdered by Islamic State, which is also known as Daesh, in 2014. John and Diane Foley accused Ms Le Pen of using the 'shamefully uncensored' photos for her own political ends. In a joint statement they said: 'We are deeply disturbed by the unsolicited use of Jim for Le Pen's political gain and hope that the picture of our son, along with the two other graphic photographs, are taken down immediately.' Ms Le Pen tweeted the decapitation photo under the caption 'This is Daesh' along with another of a man on fire in a cage, and a victim being crushed by a tank. She addressed the tweets to BFM TV journalist Jean-Jacques Bourdin, whom she accused of likening her party to the jihadist group. Manuel Valls, France's Prime Minister at the time, described the photos as 'monstrous', adding that Ms Le Pen had shown 'political and moral failing' and her 'non-respect for victims'. It was Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve who went to the police in 2015, saying the tweets should be investigated 'as they do every time these kind of photos are published'. He said the photos are 'Daesh propaganda and are a disgrace, an abomination and an absolute insult to all victims of Daesh'. Ms Le Pen was reacting to comments by Bourdin, who said there were 'links' between the National Front National and ISIS. At the time, Claude Hermant, a former National Front bodyguard, was in custody in France after being accused of supplying the guns to Amedy Coulibaly, an ISIS linked terrorist who murdered five people, including four Jews, in Paris in January 2011. Faced with outrage against France, Ms Le Pen later deleted the tweets, but the row did not stop her standing to become President of France in 2017. In elections held last Spring, she was runner up Emmanuel Macron, the current centrist head of state. Ms Le Pen's father, the FN founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, is a convicted racist, anti-Semite and Holocaust denier.

Leon's locks have made him 'the Samson of the Zoo' and the star tourist attraction. Male lions usually start to grow manes from around the age of two, which signals the onset of sexual maturity. It can be a mixed blessing because once they appear, it more often than not means the rest of the pride will throw out a dangerous young pretender. 
969217342071820288	2018-03-01 14:26:36	https://t.co/SxBy94OVIc	Diner at restaurant in Thai shopping centre films a RAT roaming around its kitchen https://t.co/SxBy94OVIc	 A restaurant in one of Thailand's luxury shopping centres has temporarily closed, this week - after rodents were spotted running amok in its kitchen. The popular branch of restaurant chain Sushi Den - located at Bangkok's high-end mall, Siam Paragon - suffered the embarrassing fate after an eagle-eyed customer spotted the infestation. Patron Narongkrit Suwancharus, who lives in the Thai capital, filmed the incident on his smartphone and uploaded the footage to social media, where it soon went viral - provoking disgust among fellow clientele. The 10-second video shows two rodents on the kitchen counter tops as shoppers and staff browse in the background. Inhabiting the areas where chefs prepare meals, one rat appears to feed from the contents of a miso soup bowl, while another tries to scale a microwave. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr Suwancharus said he swiftly cancelled his order and left the outlet. His clip quickly racked-up thousands of views and was shared across the internet. Discussing the incident, he told Morning News: 'I ordered and was waiting for my food. At some point, I looked up from my phone and saw rats! How could they get there!?' Shortly afterwards, Sushi Den apologised for the hygiene issue and announced a 24-hour closure to arrange pest control. 'We will find a solution as soon as possible,' the statement said. However, Asian news site Coconuts Bangkok reports that some think the mall's rodent problem is more widespread than first reported. 'It’s not just Sushi Den,' said one. 'The pest problem occurs all over… rats and cockroaches. I’ve seen traces of cockroaches in my cabbage at other restaurants on top floors.' Another added: 'It’s like a lottery. The rats live on the ceiling [of the mall] and they climb down. It all depends on where they go and who happens to see them. 'This restaurant just got lucky.'
969212931970920448	2018-03-01 14:09:04	https://t.co/vujwWhCNR8	Six stone anorexic who would smear food on her BODY to avoid eating it reveals how she turned her life around https://t.co/vujwWhCNR8	 A recovering anorexic told how she would avoid eating food by smearing it on her body during her battle with the debilitating illness. Annika Hof, 21, from Mainz, Germany, told how was so desperate to lose weight as a teenager that she would 'run everywhere' and would sit with her legs raised off the ground in school in a bid to 'train her abs' while sitting at her desk. At the age of 14, the 5ft 7in schoolgirl wheighed just 6st 4lbs and she was hospitalised after suffering heart and kidney failure. After failed sessions with a psychologist and at a clinic, Annika began turning her life around after realising she would never land a job if she 'looked like a sick person'. She enrolled in medical school and joined a gym, where she focused on training and toning her 'female curves'. Annika now weighs 10st 1lbs and wears a UK size 10. The medical student explained that the eating disorder spiralled after she initially cut out sweets 'to get a flatter stomach'. She said: 'First it was really hard, but then, when I saw the weight dropping, even secretly cutting out any meals under the watchful eyes of my suspicious parents became easy. 'I ran everywhere; I ran to school, always raised my legs up from the ground with a bag on them to train my abs while sitting in the car or in school for hours. 'I used to fight with my parents every day, I hid the food in my jacket or took butter from the bread and greased it on my neck.' When the schoolgirl was taken to a clinic in 2012 aged 15 to have her weight monitored, Annika did everything she could to avoid eating the food. She said: 'After the nurses in the clinic didn't give me napkins for the meals anymore, I had to be "creative" and secretly hide food on my skin under my hoodie sleeves or in my neck, to conceal it. 'I washed it off afterwards just like I threw away the food I hid in my pockets. All that led to me being strip searched for things after every meal. 'My whole life was a farce and I got so afraid to eat in public that I always tried to find an excuse to avoid eating socially. 'I then got treatment with a psychologist, where I got worse and drank four litres every day to fake my weight. 'I ended up being admitted into intensive care unit at an in-patient clinic because my heart and kidneys started failing aged 15.' It wasn't until she began applying for jobs, that she realised no employer would believe her to be a good fit if she didn't recover. 'After applying for jobs, I realised that nobody would take me seriously looking like a twelve-year-old, sick person,' she admitted. 'Another part of my recovery was starting with strength training. It helped me focus on something else, get the feeling of hunger that I lost, and regain my muscles. 'I had this moment when I stood in a lane and just felt stable and strong and it was a good feeling, not like a little wind can beat me down any second. 'I changed my goals to wanting a healthy body with trained female curves. I knew I needed to eat enough to gain muscle, so I moved out from my parents' home, started with med school, learned more about health and became more independent. 'It changed the way I perceive other people. It also increased my self-confidence. My boyfriend has a big role in that too; telling me every day that I'm beautiful. 'Overcoming anorexia has made me stronger. I have hit rock bottom, experienced a lot of pain, been admitted to hospital, all at an early age.' While she no longer counts calories, she estimates to be consuming around 3,000 a day now, making sure she eats a good amount of protein and a lot of vegetables. She incorporates strength training four times a week as part of her exercise routine. 'To accept my body's changes, not fitting into your clothes anymore, really letting go of the disease I identified myself with for a long time was the hardest part,' she said. 'It became like a safe haven, even though it is killing you and forcing you to hurt everyone that loves you... 'So, the hardest thing was to become "normal" and not sick-looking anymore, as I kept a very low weight for some years.' Annika has been helped on the journey by her family and boyfriend. She added: 'I want to convey that nobody except yourself can fight this illness. Outer motivation is a great thing, but pressure often leads to even more restriction. 'You need to take action and ask yourself if you want to sit on your porch when you are 60; weak bones, weak heart and tell people that you kept your weight really low for 40 years. 'Or if you want to tell your grandchildren about the fun you had in your life; your career and adventures you experienced with your friends and on vacation. 'Strive for being strong in a healthy way.'
969211961450926080	2018-03-01 14:05:13	https://t.co/gH0EeOzVyM	Saudi Arabia will issue tourist visas from April https://t.co/gH0EeOzVyM	 It's known for being a conservative nation with little interest in competing for foreign visitors. But that's all set to change, because ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia is finally embracing holiday-makers and will be issuing tourist visas from 1st April. The electronic passes will be given to 'all nationals whose countries allow their citizens to visit' in a bid to further modernise the desert country's global image and boost the economy. Part of wider social reform under Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, it's hoped the initiative will double the number of annual visitors to 30million by 2030. In turn, this is predicted to raise an additional $54billion (£39billion) by 2020. The overhaul is an integral part of Prince Salman's Vision 2030 plan, which will ultimately make the nation less dependent on oil. 'We recognize that Allah the Almighty has bestowed on our lands a gift more precious than oil,' his ambitious mission states. 'Our Kingdom is the Land of the Two Holy Mosques, the most sacred sites on earth, and the direction of the Kaaba (Qibla) to which more than a billion Muslims turn at prayer.' Tourist highlights are likely to include the Great Mosque of Mecca, archeological site Mada'in Saleh and the Al Fanateer Beach. Saudi'a top tourist official, Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, said the cost of the new tourist visa had not yet been settled, but stressed that it would be 'as low as possible, because we believe the cumulative economic impact is greater than the cash from the visa'. Currently, Saudi Arabia grants tourist visas for a limited number of countries, but even those applications involve a range of restrictions, including requirements to travel through an accredited company and stay at designated hotels. Saudi Arabia, though richly endowed with natural beauty, is notorious worldwide for its longstanding bans on the mixing of the sexes, alcohol consumption and, until recently, women driving. In recent months, the kingdom has broken with some of its most rigid rules - lifting a cinema ban, allowing genders to mix at a national celebration and announcing that women will be allowed to drive by June. Last August, Prince Mohammed also announced a massive tourism project to turn 50 islands and a string of sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
969207893592625152	2018-03-01 13:49:03	https://t.co/5o7UvmULGy	China 'achieves breakthrough' in developing NUCLEAR aircraft carrier https://t.co/5o7UvmULGy	 Beijing is planning to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to 'safeguard national interests', according to Chinese state media. One Chinese aircraft carrier expert was quoted saying that the country has achieved a breakthrough in nuclear-powered carriers. The same expert said the development of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is 'very necessary' and it could help China rival the U.S. navy in technology. The U.S. has 10 active aircraft carriers - the largest fleet in the world - while its main military rivals, Russia and China, only has one active carrier each, according to a report by Reuters last year. According to the World Nuclear Association, nuclear-powered reactors could run for up to 50 years without needing refuelling, which means nuclear-powered ships or submarines could remain at sea for long periods of time. The Chinese nuclear-powered carrier is being planned by the China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, according to China's Huanqiu.com, an affiliation to People's Daily. The news website also shared two pictures provided by web users. The pictures show what China's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier could look like. State-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corp said in an online press release on Tuesday that it would 'accelerate the process of building a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier', reported Huanqiu.com. This is the first time China has ever revealed its plan of a nuclear carrier. The statement also claimed that the nuclear carrier is a part of Chinese navy's plan to operate further and longer overseas by 2025. After the news was reported by media, the company has apparently edited the original online statement. In the current version, the mention of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier has been omitted. The company was responsible for extensively refurbishing China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, which arrived as a mostly empty hull from Ukraine. It has also built the country's sole domestically produced carrier, which is expected to enter service later this year. Both are conventionally fueled. Last November, the company's chairman and chief engineer Hu Wenming said to China's state broadcaster that China is able to build any type of aircraft carrier now. Li Jie, a Chinese aircraft carrier expert, told Huanqiu.com that the statement means China has achieved a breakthrough in the application of nuclear power on large-scale ships as normally state-run companies wouldn't reveal such information without confidence. Li stressed that a nuclear-powered carrier would be able to allow China to expand its overseas military presence and safeguard national interest. A spokesperson from the World Nuclear Association said the news about China's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier 'is not a surprise'. The spokesperson said: 'In February 2013, China Shipbuilding Industry Corp received state approval and funding to begin research on core technologies and safety for nuclear-powered ships. 'Polar vessels were mentioned, but it was thought that aircraft carriers would be a more likely purpose for the new development.' The spokesperson added: 'China has a long history of operating nuclear powered vessels. Its first nuclear powered submarine was decommissioned in 2013 after almost 40 years of service.' Currently, the nuclear-powered fleet carriers owned by the U.S. are without rival in the world. U.S. nuclear carriers such as the Navy's Nimitz class can operate for 20 years without refuelling. China has the world's largest navy in terms of numbers of ships, although it lags behind the U.S. in technology and combat capabilities. It's believed that China already has four types of nuclear submarines, namely the Type 091, 092, 093 and 094.

Leutnant Adolf Auer wasn't Jewish himself but was upset when commanding officer Goering made anti semitic remarks about his own wingman, Willi Rosenstein. In revenge, Lt Auer painted the six-pointed Jewish symbol on the side of his Fokker biplane for Goering to see. Scroll down for video Although the First World War had nothing to do with the Jews, Goering went on to became an early member of the Nazi party and one the most prominent leaders in the Third Reich. He was one of the architects of the Holocaust in the Second World War, ordering a high-ranking Nazi official to organise the solution to the 'Jewish Question'. He went on to appropriate important art work from Jewish victims of the genocide. Willy Rosenstein emigrated to South Africa as the Third Reich rose to power in the 1930s. Despite being a WWI flying ace - claiming nine British kills - he and his family didn't feel safe in Nazi Germany and fled. In a cruel twist, his son Ernest Rosenstein became a pilot with the South African Air Force and was killed in action while fighting for the Allies in 1945. While Lt Auer's stunt might have been laughed off in 1917, it could have led to his arrest or even execution in the Second World War. An album of 24 black and white photos that is being sold at auction 100 years later includes several pictures of him and his observer in their aircraft with the Jewish symbol next to the black iron cross. The album also includes aerial snaps taken over the Western Front, including Passchendale and bomb damage at Armentieres. There are also images showing Lt Auer with a large group of German airmen. Matthew Tredwin, of C&T Auctioneers of Ashford, Kent, said: 'It is believed that Adolf Auer was not impressed about comments made by Hermann Goring regarding his wingman, Willi Rosenstein. 'It was said that Auer painted the Jewish Star of David on his aircraft in support of Rosenstein and to annoy Goering. 'Auer was once also quoted as saying that he would rather be saved by a Jewish pilot than die in a plane crash. 'At the time there was no anti-Jew issue in Germany, it was just Hermann Goering's personal opinion at the time that he clearly carried with him into the Second World War. 'That anti-Semitic attitude served him well in the Third Reich until Germany lost the war and he was tried at Nuremberg. 'Whether Goering saw Auer's stunt as a practical joke, I don't know. But he didn't hold it against him as Auer served in the Luftwaffe in the Second World War. 'It is a very interesting album and one that makes you realise that there were these anti-Semitic views in Germany 20 years before the Third Reich rose to power.' Lt Auer scored one victory during the First World War and was wounded in action when he was brought down on October 28, 1918 and taken Prisoner of War. Willi Rosenstein scored nine aerial victories between 1917 and 1918 and received the Iron Cross. In South Africa, he carried on flying and was killed in a mid-air collision with a student pilot in 1949. The album is being sold on March 14 for an estimated £800.

969192811286409216	2018-03-01 12:49:07	https://t.co/m9vkQVJiKD	Terminator-like AI movie death scenarios are just 'one to two decades away', claims former Google chief executive https://t.co/m9vkQVJiKD	 Former Google chief Eric Schmidt believes AI technology is developing so quickly it may soon turn against its human masters. The billionaire tech leader claims Terminator-like AI movie death scenarios are 'one to two decades away' but says we should only 'worry about them in a while'. Many AI experts, including Elon Musk, have said we should be wary of a potential AI uprising. Schmidt himself has previously expressed concern about what countries such as Russia and China will do with AI weapons. In the 1984 movie Terminator a cyborg assassin disguises himself as a human. And this type of terrifying scenario might not be far off, according to the now MIT fellow Schmidt, speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month. 'Everyone immediately then wants to talk about all the movie-inspired death scenarios, and I can confidently predict to you that they are one to two decades away. 'So let's worry about them, but let's worry about them in a while,' Schmidt said, DefenseNews reported. For the ex-head of Google, the benefits and uses of AI far outweigh any of the negatives. An apocalyptic robot takeover, however unlikely, is a risk worth taking for the medical and technological advances it provides, Schmidt believes. In response to further questions about humans losing control over cyborgs, he responded: 'You've been watching too many movies. 'Let me be clear: Humans will remain in charge of [AI] for the rest of time,' he said. Schmidt believes that no matter how advanced AI becomes, it will never be perfect and it will always have inherent flaws. 'These technologies [AI] have serious errors in them, and they should not be used with life-critical decisions. 'So I would not want to be in an airplane where the computer was making all the general intelligence decisions about flying it. 'The technology is just not reliable enough ― there too many errors in its use. It is advisory, it makes you smarter and so forth, but I wouldn't put it in charge of command and control,' he said at the conference. Whilst he believes humans will always control the technology, he admits its use in weapons raises some concerns. Speaking about the development of AI-guided weapon systems around the world, he warned against ignoring what countries like China and Russia were developing. 'It's a national program. As I understand, what that means in China is that there will be hundreds of thousands of engineers produced and trained in this. 'There is no analogous United States or European doctrine, and we need to have one,' Schmidt noted. These comments from Schmidt build on previous statements where he revealed he is 'very concerned' that Russia and China are leading the race on artificial intelligence. Schmidt flagged the risk of their commercial as well as military aspirations, saying their lead in AI could help them conquer the world. It follows his warning from last year that China will overtake the US in AI by 2025. Speaking at BBC's Tomorrow's World Live at London's Science Museum with Professor Brian Cox, Schmidt, 62, admitted he worries about what rival countries could do with their technology. 'I'm very concerned about this', he said in response to a question from a member of the audience about the AI race between China and Russia. 'I think that both the Russian and the Chinese leaders have recognised the value of this, not just for their commercial aspirations, but also their military aspirations', he told the audience, writes Daily Star. It is an issue troubling some of the greatest minds in the world at the moment, from Professor Stephen Hawking to Bill Gates and Elon Musk. SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk described AI as our 'biggest existential threat' and likened its development as 'summoning the demon.' He believes super intelligent machines could use humans as pets. Professor Hawking has recently said it is a 'near certainty' that a major technological disaster will threaten humanity in the next 1,000 to 10,000 years. They could steal jobs More than 60 per cent of people fear that robots will lead to there being fewer jobs in the next ten years, according to a 2016 YouGov survey. And 27 per cent predict that it will decrease the number of jobs 'a lot' with previous research suggesting admin and service sector workers will be the hardest hit. As well as posing a threat to our jobs, other experts believe AI could 'go rogue' and become too complex for scientists to understand. A quarter of the respondents predicted robots will become part of everyday life in just 11 to 20 years, with 18 per cent predicting this will happen within the next decade. They could 'go rogue' Computer scientist Professor Michael Wooldridge said AI machines could become so intricate that engineers don't fully understand how they work. If experts don't understand how AI algorithms function, they won't be able to predict when they fail. This means driverless cars or intelligent robots could make unpredictable 'out of character' decisions during critical moments, which could put people in danger. For instance, the AI behind a driverless car could choose to swerve into pedestrians or crash into barriers instead of deciding to drive sensibly. They could wipe out humanity Some people believe AI will wipe out humans completely. 'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in a recent interview. He singled out artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' In August last year, Musk warned that AI poses more of a threat to humanity than North Korea. 'If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea,' the 46-year-old wrote on Twitter. 'Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.' Musk has consistently advocated for governments and private institutions to apply regulations on AI technology. He has argued that controls are necessary in order protect machines from advancing out of human control 'It is very, very important that the incredible engines that exist in Europe, and Britain, wherever, United States etc, get more funding for basic research, ethics and so forth', he said. Schmidt said he would like the US and Europe to deal with Russian competition not by copying their approach but by 'being more like us'. 'Let's outrun them with our own intelligence, rather than any other outcome', he said. Last year Schmidt slammed Trump's government for falling behind the Chinese government when it came to AI. 'I'm assuming our [US] lead will continue over the next five years and then that China will catch up extremely quickly,' he told the Center for New American Security's Paul Scharre at the Artificial Intelligence & Global Security Summit on Wednesday, according to Defense One. 'We need to get our act together, as a country…This is the moment when the [US] government collectively, and private industry, needs to say, 'these technologies are important.' In July last year, China unveiled its national plan for the future of artificial intelligence. 'By 2020, they will have caught up. By 2025, they will be better than us. By 2030, they will dominate the industries,' Schmidt said. Donald Trump's 2018 budget request slashes funds for basic science and research by $4.3 billion (£3 billion), roughly 13 per cent compared to 2016. 'It feels, as an American, that we are fighting this conflict with one hand behind our back. Earlier in the year Schmidt also revealed he is an 'AI denier'. 'I've taken the position of 'job elimination denier,' he told an audience at MIT according to CNBC. 'I've just decided I'm going to be contrarian, because the data supports me, and it's more fun to be in opposition anyway,' he said. Still, 'there's no question that there's job dislocation. But there [are] always new solutions,' he said. 'The economic folks would say that you can see the job that's lost, but you very seldom can see the job that's created.' Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. One group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society.
969189751843631104	2018-03-01 12:36:58	https://t.co/mkjVbJQQJg	Zoos are forced to slaughter animals to feed others in Venezuela https://t.co/mkjVbJQQJg	 Levels of poverty in Venezuela have become so acute that workers at a zoo are slaughtering animals to feed others, staff have told the AFP news agency. They say that two emaciated pumas are serving as 'poster kids' of sorts for the distressing state of affairs. The bone-thin pumas were saved from poachers, but recent photos of them published in the Panorama newspaper have shocked people across what was once an oil-rich country but is now saddled by hyperinflation and acute food and medicine shortages - largely as a result of lower petroleum prices. Scroll down for video The big cats were skinny when they first arrived at the zoo in the town of San Francisco in Zulia state near the Colombian border. They initially got better, but as Venezuela's latest crisis started to take effect 'it is as if they shrank', one zoo worker said. A male and a female Andean condor, born in captivity and brought to the park as part of a breeding program to save the endangered species, have gone weeks without being fed properly. Two birds of prey were so hungry they cannibalized a cage mate, staff said, while a Bengal tiger an elderly lion have also lost weight. To get around the lack of meat, zoo officials started hunting iguanas, which run wild in the zoo, and fishing tilapia from lagoons in the facility. The zoo has also been hit by a series of thefts since the country descended into economic chaos. In 2016, at least 40 animals including a tapir were stolen - it is thought by people looking to salvage meat. The minimum wage, equivalent to £40 a month at the official exchange rate, is barely enough to buy 4.5 pounds of meat. In 2016 at the Caricuao Zoo in Caracas, a horse was killed by assailants who salvaged its flesh to eat. In the state of Falcon, two wild pigs were stolen from a zoo. Peacocks and other birds have also been stolen from Bararida Zoo in Barquisimeto, 155 miles southwest of Caracas, said Carlos Silva, a veterinarian who has worked there for 13 years. It is not just animal in zoos that are suffering. Large numbers of people are abandoning their pet dogs in cities of the country because they are unable to feed and vaccinate them, newspaper reports say. Most of the dogs are starving and taking over garbage-lined street corners, blocking Venezuelans who scavenge for their own food there, El Nacional (in Spanish) reported. Stray dogs are not a new a problem in major cities of the country, with reports from two years ago suggesting that the nation's poorest have always hunted and eaten them. But in January, a non-governmental organization found that more and more Venezuelans, unable to afford anything else, were buying dog food to feed their families. El Nacional cites a local NGO, the Canine Support Network (RAC), as finding a sharp increase in the number of pet abandonments documented over the last two years. 'Unfortunately, we see ourselves immersed in this difficult economic crossroads and there are people who, perhaps against their will, see themselves in the difficult situation of abandoning their pet,' Moises Gonzalez, who helps direct the group's spay and neuter efforts, told the newspaper. 'I would say we found a 100 percent increase in the number of people who write to us because they can no longer have their pets because they are leaving the country or they don't have the resources [to feed it].' The situation is reported to be especially dire for prisoners in the country who have resorted to eating rats and pigeons to avoid starving to death. Inmate Alejandro Manuel Mago Coraspe, 41, was reported recently by local media to need urgent hospital treatment for food poisoning after eating dead rats he found in the garbage. 'We cooked them, but they were still raw,' he said, according to El Nuevo Herald. 'We ate them anyway. I think they were poisonous and that's why I fell ill. I normally kill them myself.' According to a medical report, the bones and cartilage of the rats 'obstructured his intestine', forcing the severely malnourished prisoner to undergo immediate surgery. Stories of degradation and deprivation come out of Venezuela at a 'relentless clip'. The Washington Post recently reported. 'There are lurid tales of prison inmates foraging for dead rats, pumas and lions wasting away in Venezuelan zoos, and mothers embarking on harrowing cross-border trips just to find medicine for their children,' the newspaper said. The country's tragic implosion means there is a lack of contraceptives and drugs, HIV patients are flooding hospitals and AIDS-related deaths have surged. Destitute parents, starved and unable to cope, are abandoning their children at orphanages; mismanagement and graft turned one of the world's most oil-rich countries into a gasoline importer whose economy is at the edge of an abyss. It is estimated that as many as four million Venezuelans - more than 10 percent of the population - have left the country. That is an exodus on a similar scale to that of war-torn in Syria. U.N. statistics show that since November, more than 600,000 Venezuelans have fled to Colombia, 5,000 to the Caribbean isle of Curacao, 20,000 to Aruba, 30,000 to Brazil and 40,000 to Trinidad and Tobago. The opposition for its part is weak and divided. On Tuesday a former state governor who said he would stand against President Maduro in April's elections was expelled from the Democratic Unity opposition coalition which is boycotting the vote. It said Henri Falcon was erroneously endorsing a fraudulent electoral system. But Mr Falcon has defended his decision, saying he wanted to defeat a government that had 'promised Venezuelans paradise, but given them hell'. Meanwhile the Trump administration is considering sanctioning a Venezuelan military-run oil services company and restricting insurance coverage for Venezuelan oil shipments to ratchet up pressure on Socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a U.S. official said on Wednesday. With Maduro running for another term in an April election that Washington and its allies oppose as a sham, the U.S. is weighing sanctions that would target Venezuela's vital oil sector beyond what has been done before, the official told Reuters. Some measures could come before the vote and others could be imposed afterwards. The official, who is close to U.S. internal deliberations on Venezuela policy and spoke on condition of anonymity, would not rule out an eventual full-scale ban on Venezuelan oil shipments to the U.S. - among the toughest of oil-related sanctions. Large demonstrations in Venezuela last year against Maduro's increasingly authoritarian government were stifled by the authorities which replaced the opposition-filled Congress with a new Constituent Assembly stacked with presidential loyalists. The body deployed sweeping powers to cow dissent and paved the way for April's elections, The Washington Post said. But all of these measures have been rejected by most of the international community, which views any election in the current climate of intimidation as a fraudulent farce. 
969187763391291392	2018-03-01 12:29:04	https://t.co/452ue4IJlh	There is NOT enough evidence to prove a healthy diet protects against dementia, declare advisers https://t.co/452ue4IJlh	 There is insufficient evidence that a healthy diet protects against dementia, health officials have declared in a new report. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition warned there is no magic nutrient or supplement that slashes the risk of the neurological disorder. Scores of medical trials that delved into the link between diet and dementia were examined by the Government advisers. The report concluded that adhering to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. However, it stressed most evidence behind this comes from observational studies - meaning no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. They also found there is little evidence to draw any conclusions on the association between other 'healthy' diets and risk of cognitive impairment. And there is not enough evidence currently to confirm a link between taking B, C and E vitamins or omega-3 fatty acids and risk of dementia. The authors also found that the evidence is 'limited' and indicates that there is no association between caffeine intake and cognition over the longer term. SACN - comprised of leading researchers from British universities - advises Public Health England and other UK Government organisations on nutrition. Following the publication of the report, the committee has now called for more scientific trials to establish links between diet and dementia. Commenting on the review, PHE said the report broadly supports existing advice to eat healthily. Eating a healthy diet can help people to achieve lifestyle factors linked to a lower risk of dementia such as maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure. But PHE said overall, there is not enough evidence to support a relationship between prevention of dementia and diet. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: 'This report broadly supports existing advice to eat a healthy diet as depicted in the Eatwell Guide. 'However, the report indicates that, overall, there isn't currently enough evidence to support a relationship between diet and the prevention of dementia.' NHS advice to reduce the risk of dementia is to eat a healthy diet, maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, do not drink too much alcohol, stop smoking and maintaining a healthy blood pressure. Dr Matthew Norton, director of policy and impact at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'The brain, just like other parts of the body, can be affected by the way we live our lives. 'While a balanced diet is one way to maintain a healthy brain, the best current evidence suggests supplements or nutrients offer no additional preventative value. 'Wider evidence points to a number of other lifestyle factors that can also play a role. 'Not smoking, staying mentally and physically active, only drinking in moderation and keeping blood pressure and cholesterol in check are all ways to keep the brain healthy into later life.' Dr Doug Brown, chief policy and research officer at the Alzheimer's Society, said: 'There's no evidence that eating a certain food or taking a specific vitamin or supplement can affect the risk of dementia, but we do know that people who eat a Mediterranean-style diet tend to have a lower risk of dementia. 'Dementia is set to be the 21st century's biggest killer and with no way yet to cure the condition, prevention is key. 'We recommend eating plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains, having fish twice a week, and using healthier fats like olive oil. 'It's also a good idea to cut down on red meat, saturated fats, refined sugar and salty foods. 'We're still waiting for proof from big trials to show whether changing your diet can reduce the risk of dementia, and by how much. 'But eating a healthy, balanced diet can reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and stroke, so it's likely eating healthily is a good way to look after the health of your brain too.' A GLOBAL CONCERN Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a range of progressive neurological disorders, that is, conditions affecting the brain. There are many different types of dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most common. Some people may have a combination of types of dementia. Regardless of which type is diagnosed, each person will experience their dementia in their own unique way. Dementia is a global concern but it is most often seen in wealthier countries, where people are likely to live into very old age. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED? The Alzheimer’s Society reports there are more than 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK today. It is estimated that the number of people living with dementia in the UK by 2025 will rise to over 1 million. In the US, it's estimated there are 5.5 million sufferers. A similar percentage rise is expected in the coming years. As a person’s age increases, so does the risk of them developing dementia. Rates of diagnosis are improving but many people with dementia are thought to still be undiagnosed. IS THERE A CURE? Currently there is no cure for dementia. But new drugs can slow down its progression and the earlier it is spotted the more effective treatments are. Source: Dementia UK 
969182720986402816	2018-03-01 12:09:01	https://t.co/aAJtV0Xcms	Storm Emma leaves its mark on Europe with three dead in Spain https://t.co/aAJtV0Xcms	 People in Ireland have begun panic-buying supplies after the entire country was told to get inside and stay there for 24 hours as the Beast from the East and Storm Emma combined to produce life-threatening conditions. CCTV from one store in Dublin posted on Twitter by Sky News reporter Darren McCaffrey captured desperate shoppers grabbing armfuls of loaves from a worker before he even had a chance to put them on the shelves. Elsewhere supermarket freezers and bread sections were pictured empty as the government warned people to get inside before 4pm and stay there until the weather passes, which is expected to be around 3pm on Friday. The warning came as Dublin airport announced it was cancelling all flights until Saturday morning at the earliest due to snow and ice, with all schools closed and most public transport in the country shutting down. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: 'The risk to life and limb presented by severe weather conditions should not be underestimated by anyone. The forecast is for zero visibility, deep pockets of snow and 'white-outs'. 'It's not safe to be outside in such conditions. No-one should be on the roads,' the Taoiseach said. As Ireland braced for the worst, at least three people died in Spain because of the cold weather and the remains of an 84-year-old woman were found burined in snow in Denmark. Emergency services battled to free more than 2,000 motorists from their cars near Montpellier, in the south of France, after heavy snow shut a major motorway overnight with flakes also blanketing the beaches in Nice. One man told a local radio station that he had been trapped in his car for 24 hours, with emergency services promising to recue him on Wednesday night, but crews still hadn't showed up by 8am on Thursday. Police say she left her home Wednesday evening and was found Thursday in a park in Roskilde, west of Copenhagen. Southern Denmark has been hit by heavy snowfall and local police have urged motorists not to use their cars. In Tenerife an oil rig was cast adrift before smashing into the side of a cargo ship moored nearby as the Canary Islands were battered by winds up to 150km/h (93mph) from Storm Emma. Video footage shows the 91m-wide rig in the port of Santa Cruz beginning to drift after high winds broke its moorings before it hit the ship just before midnight. Maritime Rescue, the Civil Guard and the police rushed to the scene before divers were brought in to seal the ship's hull and pump out the sea water. 'It took until about 5am to control but fortunately there was no fuel leakage,' said Port Authority spokesman. Storm Emma has already caused considerable damage on the islands, including La Palma. Parts of rural Tenerife, La Gomera, Gran Canaria and El Hierro have been left without electricity as the winds blew down power lines. Seven boats have been damaged by the storm and another containing ten tonnes of fuel was sunk, but fortunately did not spill into the sea. On Tuesday the 112 emergency control centre dealt with more than 500 incidents across the islands and 46 flights were either cancelled or delayed. Hundreds more flights have also been cancelled or delayed across the rest of the continent due to snow. Geneva Airport was closed 'until further notice' on Wednesday morning after five inches of snow was dumped on the runway in three hours, leaving grounds crews struggling to cope. Dublin airport also cancelled all flights until Saturday morning at the earliest because of a red weather warning put in place, meaning there is a serious danger to life. After Irish carriers Aer Lingus and Ryanair both said they would suspend flight operations, the airport said in a statement that 'all other airlines are suspending operations from about 3pm today'. Both Aer Lingus and budget airline Ryanair said they plan to resume operations on Saturday morning. 'Given the Red Weather Alert for later today and tomorrow, it is unlikely that other airlines will operate to or from Dublin Airport on Friday and they are likely to resume operations on Saturday morning,' said the airport. 'We will have snow crews working today and tomorrow to continue to clear the runway, taxiways, aircraft parking stands and apron areas for our airline customers' planned resumption of services on Saturday morning.' Montpellier, Pau and Biarritz airports also announced there would be cancellations or delays as they struggled to cope with the highly unusual weather. Flights were also disrupted in Spain as national network operatorAENA warned travellers to expect delays and cancellations at Bilbao, San Sebastián, Pamplona and Logroño. Italy continued to be blanketed with a thick layer of snow on Wednesday as the cold weather reached the Gulf of Naples with flakes falling on Mount Vesuvius. Even Sardiania, which rarely sees temperatures fall below freezing in an average year, saw a dusting of snow across hilly areas on Wednesday. Further north Florence's iconic Duomo and Ponte Vecchio were also consumed by the wintry weather as snow also bgan falling in Bologna. While Germany escaped the worst of the snow on Thursday temperatures across the entire country remained below freezing and were not expected to rise above melting point over the weekend.

Not content with monitoring the movements of its own users, the largest social network in the world is building secret files on the activities of billions of people. Mark Zuckerburg's company says that is uses this information to target adverts and content based on your preferences, as well as for security purposes. Facebook account holders are able to download a copy of the file kept on them, which contains detailed records of their activities while logged in. The privacy of users tracked via-third parties is currently less transparent, with no way of checking exactly what Facebook knows about you. Scroll down for video Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, uses data gathered from its 1.4 billion daily active users worldwide as a basis for algorithms which link advertising and other materials to a person's online profile. It can collect data on every element of your digital identity on the network, from your search and Messenger chat history to photos you've uploaded and files sent across its servers. Facebook also makes use of social media plug-ins and cookies - tracking devices that follow a user's internet activity - to collect data via third-party websites. Every time you like or share Facebook content or visit sites with Facebook ads and trackers you are being watched, even if you aren't signed in. Even if you have never entered the Facebook domain, the company is still able to follow your browsing behaviour without you knowing it. More than 10,000 websites contain invisible trackers, called Pixels, which record information about visitors. This includes everything from the operating system you use to your IP address and activities on the website during a session. This gives the firm insights into everything from where you are in the world, who your internet service provider is, the types of sites you like to visit and how long you spend on them. A cookie's content is determined by the specific website that created it and vary from site to site. As a general rule, cookies are text files containing random alphanumeric text characters. They are intended to help you access a site faster and more efficiently. For example, cookies can store information to help you enter a site without having to login. When the user visits a website's login page, the web server typically sends the client a cookie containing a unique session identifier. When the user successfully logs in, the server remembers that that particular session identifier has been authenticated, and grants the user access to its services. Tracking cookies, especially those used by third-parties, are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories. They can collect information including IP address, length of visit, pages visited, length of time spent on a page, in what sequence pages were accessed. Advertisers can use this information collected to build up a digital profile of a user. This might not be linked o your real world identity, using a user ID rather than your name, although some websites may link this to your account name. By adding tags to a page, advertisers can track a user or their device across different websites. That helps build a profile of them based on their habits, so messages can be better targeted to their interests. Nick Whigham, a reporter for the New Zealand Herald, decided to test out what Facebook knew about him and was surprised by the results. In 2010, Facebook was the first big social media firm to give its users the option to download a file containing their personal history on the service. Among the information gathered by the firm on Mr Wingham was a mobile recording of an old VHS video of his mother hugging him as he left for his first day of pre-school. He also stumbled across scanned copies of tenancy agreements, bills for his home broadband service and screen shots of bank transfers, as well as more banal chat logs and other site history. To access your personalised digital footprint on Facebook, click on the top-right dropdown menu, click on settings and then 'Download a copy of your data file.' Facing a growing backlash over privacy concerns, Facebook has responded by attempting to offer greater transparency about what it knows. Just yesterday, users who logged onto Facebook reported seeing a message from the firm on their News Feed outlining several new facial recognition features. The features were first announced last December, but Facebook has been gradually rolling them out over the past several months. The firm is giving people greater clarity about what its facial recognition features do and, most importantly, the fact that they can opt-out of the system entirely. Concerns over Facebook's tracking activities and its handling of sensitive information have already landed the company in legal trouble. In February, a Belgian court ordered Facebook to stop tracking internet users in the country who have no accounts with the social network, or face fines of €250,000 (£222,000 / $305,000) a day. Speaking at the time, Johannes Kleis, a spokesman for the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), said: 'This is a big win for internet users who don't want tech companies to monitor every step they make online. 'What Facebook is doing is against Europe's data protection laws and should be stopped throughout the EU.' Facebook said the cookies and pixels it uses are 'industry standard technologies,' allowing hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow and reach customers. 'We are disappointed with today's verdict and intend to appeal,' Facebook said in a statement. 'Over recent years we have worked hard to help people understand how we use cookies to keep Facebook secure and show them relevant content. 'We've built teams of people who focus on the protection of privacy, from engineers to designers, and tools that give people choice and control.' That same month, a federal judge denied Facebook's attempt to dismiss a class-action lawsuit by users in Illinois who say the firm violated their privacy by collecting and storing biometric data without their consent. The government in Australia is also looking into ways in which Facebook and other digital platforms operate. The average time Australians spend on Facebook every day is 1.7 hours a day, according to a Nielsen report. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is set to investigate how the site collects data about its users and how they use that information. The public will be asked to provide feedback on several points relating to the ACCC investigation and have until April 3 to do so. A final report is due in December. Another part of the inquiry will look at the impact of Facebook and Google on traditional media and how the public access news. Rod Sims, the ACCC chairman, said: 'Digital platforms like Google and Facebook are part of the sweeping technological and cultural changes overhauling the media landscape in Australia and globally. 'While these technological changes have brought many benefits for consumers, this inquiry will have a particular focus on examining whether the changes affect the quality and range of news supplied to Australian consumers.' He added the inquiry aims to understand 'the evolving nature of the way consumers search and receive news in Australia'. Facebook uses personal data it collects on members using their on-site activity, location settings and internet connection to target its ads. The firm uses 98 data points to create 'complete consumer profiles'. Some of this data is taken from your Faebook profile information, but the social network watches online activity for the rest. It can 'see' virtually every website you visit if you are logged into Facebook. The 98 data points it tracks are: 1. Location 2. Age 3. Generation 4. Gender 5. Language 6. Education level 7.

969172688920080391	2018-03-01 11:29:10	https://t.co/LtlsstCLIb	Polish law that makes it illegal to accuse Poland of crimes committed on its soil by the Nazis comes into effect https://t.co/LtlsstCLIb	 A Polish law that makes it a crime to accuse the Polish nation of crimes that were committed by Nazi Germany has taken effect. The law is seen by some as part of a larger effort by the nationalist authorities to manipulate history so that the country is not associated with war crimes. Poland is at the same time trying to defuse its biggest standoff with Israel in at least three decades over the law, which has drawn warnings from the U.S. and other allies that it is parlously close to denying the crimes of the Holocaust. For years Polish officials have struggled to fight phrases like 'Polish death camps' that are routinely used abroad to describe death camps that were built and operated by Nazi Germany on occupied Polish territory during World War Two. Some Poles fear that as memories of the war grow more distant, new generations will mistakenly come to believe that Poles were the perpetrators of the Holocaust. But Holocaust survivors and some officials fear its true aim is to repress research on Poles who killed Jews during World War II. Polish officials however have insisted that the law, which calls for prison sentences of up to three years, will only punish those who publicly and 'against the facts' accuse the Polish nation as a whole for crimes committed by the Germans. As the law took effect Thursday, Polish and Israeli representatives were in Jerusalem holding a first working meeting toward resolving a standoff over the law. 'I can't imagine two nations that are both victims of the war not being able to find common ground,' government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska told Bloomberg. 'We have to do all we can so that many centuries of good Polish-Jewish relations can continue.' The law has also created tensions with Ukraine due to a provision that criminalizes denying the wartime crimes of Ukrainian nationalists, who killed up to about 100,000 Poles in wartime massacres. Poland's president signed the law last month but also sent it to the constitutional court for review. Polish officials have said no criminal charges will be brought until the court has made its ruling, expected in several weeks. But prosecutors are already looking for cases where Poland is defamed over its wartime activities. The U.S. for its part has warned that the law could stifle free expression and academic research. It has warned Poland that to go through with it could hurt Poland's strategic relationships with both the U.S. and Israel. In response the Polish government has dispatched its foreign ministry's undersecretary of state, Marek Magierowski, to Washington this week to meet administration officials, lawmakers and Jewish groups in a bid to allay their fears. Magierowski said Wednesday that the government had been surprised by the outcry over the legislation and allowed that Warsaw had not properly 'prepared the groundwork' for explaining the law's intent and impact. At the same time, he said, media reports and comments from foreign politicians had 'brutally misinterpreted' the law and its intent. Magierowski said Poland would never 'whitewash' its history and the fact that some Poles did commit 'ignoble acts' during World War Two. But, he said the law gave the government a means to fight back when the country is accused of complicity in the Holocaust. Previous attempts to push back, such as protesting use of the phrase 'Polish death camps,' had been unsuccessful, he said. 'Those efforts had been fruitless,' he said, adding that the new law is a necessary 'legal tool to allow us to fend off the narrative of Polish complicity.'

The asteroid, dubbed 2018 DV1, will miss our planet by just 65,000 miles (105,000km) away - one third of the distance between Earth and the moon. The asteroid has a diameter of between 20 to 40 feet (5.6 to 12 metres) and was only spotted on Monday thanks to the world's most powerful telescopes. Now with a virtual telescope project, people all over the world have a chance to see the small asteroid rocket past using a live webcast. Scroll down for video Astronomers say this latest pass should not cause alarm and is the 18th known asteroid to fly within one lunar distance to our planet since the beginning of this year. We are only hearing more about them bow because astronomers have got better at detecting them, writes Earth Sky. Star gazers can view the 2018 DV1 as it skims past our planet using the 16-inch robotic telescope at the Tenagra Observatories in Arizona as part of the Virutal Telescope Project and Tenagra Observatories. The webcast will begin at 12:30 a.m. EST (0530 GMT) tomorrow. Earlier this month, a space rock, called 2018 CB, also blazed past at just one-fifth of the distance between our planet and the moon. The asteroid was between 50 and 130 feet (15 and 40 metres) wide and an expert warned that an asteroid of this size would only get this close to our planet 'once or twice a year'. It was first spotted by the Nasa-funded Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) near Tucson, Arizona. 'Although 2018 CB is quite small, it might well be larger than the asteroid that entered the atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia, almost exactly five years ago, in 2013,' said Paul Chodas, manager of the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'Asteroids of this size do not often approach this close to our planet - maybe only once or twice a year.' However, not all asteroids do pass safety from our planet. In February 2013 a 19-metre meter (62-feet) meteor exploded in the skies above Chelyabinsk in Russia. The meteorite broke up into multiple pieces as it entered the atmosphere, scattering space debris and creating a shock wave estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs. Currently Nasa would not be able to deflect an asteroid if it were heading for Earth but it could mitigate the impact and take measures that would protect lives and property. This would include evacuating the impact area and moving key infrastructure. Finding out about the orbit trajectory, size, shape, mass, composition and rotational dynamics would help experts determine the severity of a potential impact. However, the key to mitigating damage is to find any potential threat as early as possible. Nasa is currently moving forward with a refrigerator-sized spacecraft capable of preventing asteroids from colliding with Earth. A test with a small, nonthreatening asteroid is planned for 2024. This is the first-ever mission to demonstrate an asteroid deflection technique for planetary defence. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) would use what is known as a kinetic impactor technique—striking the asteroid to shift its orbit. The impact would change the speed of a threatening asteroid by a small fraction of its total velocity, but by doing so well before the predicted impact, this small nudge will add up over time to a big shift of the asteroid's path away from Earth. It caused a shock wave that smashed windows, damaged buildings and injured 1,600 people.

It's said the 10-year-old girl was disobedient to her father and got punished. Local police found her covering in bruises and scratches soon after they received reports. A 38-year-old man, surnamed Wei, was arrested in Guangxi Province and detained in connection with child abuse allegations. A three-minute-long mobile phone footage shows Mr Wei beating his daughter's bottom, back and head with a wooden stick. She can be heard screaming and crying loud but no one is stopping the father. The man then drags his daughter behind a scooter and drives away along a road covered in rubble. The video was believed to be taken in Ya Long town in Da Hua Yao Autonomous County of Guangxi Province on February 28. Da Hua Police has launched an investigation soon as they received the footage at 3:50pm on the day. According to the official statement, they found Mr Wei and his daughter at a market 20 minutes later. The 10-year-old was taken to hospital where doctors treated her scratches and bruise marks on her body, including shoulder and back. She will be staying at the hospital for a head scan and a psychotherapy session. Mr Wei was arrested and detained by the police for child abuse. Mr Wei admitted that he went to his relative's house to take her to school and ended up beating her as she refused to leave, reported Beijing News. Da Hua Police is undertaking an investigation for further details.
969162415656112130	2018-03-01 10:48:20	https://t.co/FXi7hb2ZvR	Putin says Russia has tested new nuclear weapons that are 'invulnerable to interception' https://t.co/FXi7hb2ZvR https://t.co/fmThPtp1PM	 President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia has tested an array of new nuclear weapons 'invulnerable to enemy interception' in a speech where he praised scientists behind the arsenal as 'the heroes of our time'. In his annual state-of-the-nation speech in Moscow, Putin said the weapons include a nuclear-powered cruise missile, a nuclear-powered underwater drone and new hypersonic missile and showed video footage the launch of a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile on big screens. The video footage also contained a computer generated sequence showing the potential power and reach of the new rocket, which included bombs raining down over the U.S. state of Florida. During his speech, Putin said the creation of the new weapons has made NATO's U.S.-led missile defense 'useless,' and means an effective end to what he described as Western efforts to stymie Russia's development. He said: 'I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country's development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened. 'You have failed to contain Russia.' Speaking of the new arsenal, Putin said that the nuclear-powered cruise missile tested last fall has an unlimited range and high speed and maneuverability allowing it to pierce any missile defense. The Russian leader said the high-speed underwater drone also has an 'intercontinental' range and is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that could target both aircraft carriers and coastal facilities. He said its operational depth and high speed would make it immune to enemy intercept, adding: 'It's just fantastic!' Putin added to applause that names for the nuclear-powered cruise missile and the drone haven't yet been chosen, and suggested that the Defense Ministry run a nationwide contest for the best names. The President accompanied his statement to an audience of hundreds of senior officials and lawmakers with videos and computer images of new weapons, which were shown on giant screens at a conference hall near the Kremlin. 'No one in the world has anything like that,' he said. 'It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.' The Russian leader said that another new weapon called Avangard is an intercontinental hypersonic missile that would fly to targets at a speed 20 times the speed of sound and strike 'like a meteorite, like a fireball.' 'This makes it absolutely invincible for any forms of air and missile defence,' he boasted, calling it an 'ideal weapon'. Putin said that Russia also tested a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, called Sarmat, with a range and number of warheads exceeding its Soviet-era predecessor, known in the West as Satan. He praised a new generation of young scientists working on such weaponry, calling them 'the heroes of our time'. The Russian leader emphasized that the development of new weapons that have no equivalent in the West came in response to the U.S. withdrawal from a Cold war-era treaty banning missile defenses and U.S. efforts to develop a missile defense system. He said that the U.S. has ignored Russian complaints. 'No one has listened to us,' he said. 'You listen to us now.' He said the new weapons will help ensure global stability and draw a line under attempts to weaken Russia. He said that another weapons system, called Kinzhal, or Dagger, already has been deployed in Russia's Southern Military District. He said it's a hypersonic missile carried by an aircraft that that flies at 10 times the speed of sound with an unpredictable trajectory towards its target. Today's televised speech was timed to closely precede the March 18 election, in which Putin is set to easily win a fourth term. The Russian leader's approval ratings top 80 per cent despite an economic slowdown caused by continuing tensions with the West and a drop in global oil prices.

Anastasia Kysluk was found dead in a barn at her home in the village of Rudka in western Ukraine after watching snuff videos on the internet and looking for information online about the best type of rope to use. Police spokeswoman Inna Glega told local media: 'During the hour before committing suicide the girl was watching online clips of people hanging themselves. 'She also was interested in how to make a noose.' The spokeswoman added that Anastasia had been a member of the Blue Whale suicide game. She hanged herself after receiving an order from the organisation's leader, it is claimed. The Blue Whale Suicide game is a social media group which encourages people to kill themselves. It's thought a group administrator assigns daily tasks to members, which they have to complete over 50 days. The horrific tasks include self-harming, watching horror movies and waking up at unusual hours, but these gradually get more extreme. On the 50th day, the controlling manipulators behind the game reportedly instruct the youngsters to commit suicide. The girl's body was found by her grandparents with whom she had been living while her mother worked in Poland to raise money to send her to a prestigious school. The 12-year-old was described by her teachers as an excellent student who was studying English, German and Polish and who dreamt of becoming an interpreter. Teacher Olena Rozhytska said: 'She was such a bright and intelligent girl, always in a good mood, always smiling. She had so many friends. 'Her mother was going to take her to live and study in Poland. 'But now she will have to watch her daughter be buried instead. It's such tragedy for all of us. I can't still believe that she's gone.' Shocked school friends said they hadn't noticed anything peculiar in Anastasia's behaviour prior to her death. One friend said: 'The day before her death she was speaking with me online and asking what our home work was. 'Everything seemed fine. The next day I was told that she had hung herself. 'I'm still in shock.' Another classmate added: 'She had been looking forward to the summer shades so much. She dreamt about going to the sea with her mother. She loved the sea so much.'

969154443223732229	2018-03-01 10:16:39	https://t.co/XDL7OPl39Y	New species of 'indestructible' tardigrade discovered in Japan https://t.co/XDL7OPl39Y	 A new species of tardigrade has been discovered in Japan. Tardigrades are small animals that exist all over the planet and are known for being able to survive in incredibly hostile environments. Previously, researchers knew of only 167 taridigrade species in Japan. But new research published by scientists from Poland's Jagiellonian University in the journal Plos One details the discovery of a new species in a Japanese parking lot. Scroll down for video Tardigrades are sometimes referred to as moss piglets or water bears. A growing body of research proves that the microscopic animals can survive unbelievably harsh conditions. For example, they can live a decade without water and can survive in outer space. For the research, scientists examined a moss sample which was collected in a parking lot in Japan. They analyzed the sample, searching for tardigrades, and extracted 10 individuals from it. Then these individuals were used to begin a laboratory culture, which, then, was used to obtain an even greater number of individuals needed for analyses. During this step of the research they analyzed the individuals' DNA and looked for different molecular markers. They did so in an attempt to classify the newly-discovered species. The scientists also employed phase contrast light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy during this process. In order to differentiate between the different species the researchers were studying, the scientists examined the tardigrades' eggs. The new analysis explained: 'This new tardigrade species has a solid egg surface, placing it in the persimilis subgroup within the hufelandi complex. 'The eggs also have flexible filaments attached, resembling those of two other recently described species, Macrobiotus paulinae from Africa and Macrobiotus polypiformis from South America.' The researchers discovered by way of morphological and phylogenetic analyses the existence of the new species, called M. shonaicus sp. nov., bumping up the known number of tardigrade species living in Japan to 168. Researcher Kazuharu Arakawa said: 'We revisit the large and long-standing Macrobiotus hufelandi group of tardigrades, originally described by Schultze in 1834 and where M. shonaicus also belongs, and suggest that the group contains two clades with different egg morphology.' Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are said to be the most indestructible animals in the world. These small, segmented creatures come in many forms - there are more than 900 species of them - and they're found everywhere in the world, from the highest mountains to the deepest oceans. They have eight legs (four pairs) and each leg has four to eight claws that resemble the claws of a bear. Boil the 1mm creatures, freeze them, dry them, expose them to radiation and they're so resilient they'll still be alive 200 years later. Water bears can live through temperatures as low as -457 degrees, heat as high as 357 degrees, and 5,700 grays of radiation, when 10-20 grays would kill humans and most other animals. Tardigrades have been around for 530 million years and outlived the dinosaurs. The animals can also live for a decade without water and even survive in space. Additionally, study author Daniel Stec told Plos One: 'The most basic reason [tardigrades are important] is human curiosity, and once you fall in love with tardigrades you only want to know more, especially since there is still so much to discover about them. 'However, there are also other reasons [to study them]. 'Recently, tardigrades started to be used as model organisms in a variety of studies ranging from astrobiology, developmental and cell biology, physiology, evolutionary ecology and many other disciplines, in hope to address more general questions.'
969150019201847296	2018-03-01 09:59:05	https://t.co/Cd3AUqypZu	China's announces plans for £2billion 'super highway' for self-driving cars https://t.co/Cd3AUqypZu	 China has announced its plan to build an 'intelligent super highway' for self-driving vehicles. The 100-mile expressway is expected to connect three major cities in China, which already has one of the largest highway networks in the world. The project would cost 17.4 billion yuan (£2 billion), according to Chinese media. Equipped with solar panels, the cutting-edge traffic link could also charge electric cars on the go and allow drivers to pay tolls without stopping. The six-lane Hang-Shao-Yong Expressway is set to link Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, with two medium-size cities in the same province, Shaoxing and Ningbo. The first part of the highway is expected to open to the public in 2021, according to China's Xinhua News Agency. Reng Zhong, the Deputy Minister of Transport in Zhejiang, said in the report that in the long run a smart traffic controlling system would be installed on the highway and in the cars so that the road could support autonomous vehicles. Sun Zhang, a professor at Shanghai Tongji University, told Global Times: 'Automatic driving is comparatively safe compared with the manual drive mode. 'Sensors installed within the vehicles and on the road can react faster than humans when emergencies occur and detect malfunctions so as to ensure road safety.' Apparently, a comprehensive sensing, monitoring and early warning system has also been designed for the motorway to reduce traffic jams. Drivers wouldn't need to stop at tollgates to pay for their tolls. A chip installed in their cars would pay the bills automatically when they drive on the 'super highway', said Prof. Sun. The expressway would have a top speed limit of 120kmh (75mph). In addition, it's expected that the advanced traffic and vehicle management system could increase a vehicle's average travelling speed by 20 to 30 per cent. China has the world's fastest growing highway system. The country has built 10,000 kilometers (6,213 miles) of expressways since 2011, according to China's State Council. The nation now has over 130,000 kilometers (80,778 miles) of highways nationwide, said the State Council, which is enough to go around the equator three times. China has opened the country's first solar-powered highway in Jinan, Shandong Province. The two-kilometre-long (1.2 mile-long) highway is built with solar panels and 'transparent concrete'. The two-lane road could charge electric cars as they are travelling on it andwarm itself up in sub-zero weather to melt the snow on top. 
969146378978037760	2018-03-01 09:44:37	https://t.co/X2vsjQ6Zzx	Palestinian jihadist who stabbed a man to death and wounded six others at a German supermarket is jailed for life https://t.co/X2vsjQ6Zzx	 A Palestinian asylum seeker who stabbed a man to death and injured six others during a rampaging attack at a German supermarket was sentenced to life in prison. Ahmad Alhaw, 27, admitted to the murder and assaults in the river port city of Hamburg in January and was sentenced today. Grabbing an eight-inch knife from the shelves on July 28 last year, he shouted 'Allahu Akbar' as he set upon a 50-year-old woman and four men. The judge said the 'particular severity' of the crimes lowered Alhaw's chances of being able to apply for early release on parole. The attack stemmed from a 'radical Islamist' motive and Alhaw hoped to 'die as a martyr', prosecutors said. They added he wanted to kill as many German Christians as possible to avenge the suffering of Muslims worldwide. 'He wanted his actions to be viewed in the context of an Islamist attack, and understood as a contribution to jihad worldwide,' they added. A 20-year-old store assistant who witnessed the attack said: 'I saw him run toward me, covered in blood. He was radiating bloodlust.' After Alhaw emerged from the supermarket, seven mostly migrant bystanders tried to stop the screaming attacker, throwing rocks and chairs at him to slow him down until police arrived. The men - among them a 30-year-old man of Turkish descent who was wounded in the struggle - have since been celebrated and honoured for their courage. One of them, Afghan asylum seeker Toufiq Arab, told Bild daily: 'I'm not a hero, I only did my duty.' Alhaw's attack was the first in Germany since December 2016, when Tunisian Anis Amri rammed a stolen truck into a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12. Like Amri, Alhaw was due to be deported after his asylum application was rejected, although this process was slowed down as they had to wait for identity documents. Through an Arabic translator, Alhaw told the court he had sought asylum in Norway in 2009 after giving up dentistry studies in Egypt, hoping for a better life in Europe. After his application was rejected, he moved around the EU, living in Sweden, Spain and finally Germany. He was 'fascinated' by the Western lifestyle and enjoyed drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, with only 'phases' of religiosity, Alhaw said. But 'he had the feeling that he was not welcome in these countries,' he added. Alhaw himself declined to discuss his suspected religious radicalisation or details of his crimes. 'He knows that he has committed very serious crimes and knows he will be sentenced for them,' defender Burchard said. Security services had come under scrutiny after failing to recognise Alhaw was self-radicalising in the lead up to the attack. He had watched ISIS propaganda videos online, grew increasingly religious and became distrustful of state authorities. By 2016 he thought that he suddenly understood the Koran completely, rejected all previous temptations, and started looking at all other people as either true believers or non-believers, the psychiatrist said. Alhaw said the knife attack had not been his decision but God's will. But he surprised the court in a February 19 hearing when he appeared with his beard shaved off and for the first time showed remorse. 'Unfortunately I can't turn back time,' he told the victims and the relatives of the man he killed. 'All I can do is to ask you for forgiveness.' Alhaw had told interrogators that the crime 'had some connection with events on the Temple Mount' in Jerusalem, where Israeli authorities had recently imposed anti-terror controls for Muslim worshippers, prosecutor Yasemin Tuz told the court. 'The results of the investigation show that the accused sought out his victims indiscriminately, retaliating against people who in his view represent perpetrators of injustice targeting Muslims,' prosecutors had earlier said. Investigators, however, did not find any evidence to suggest that Alhaw was a member of ISIS. 
969401927057444865	2018-03-02 02:40:04	https://t.co/uuM2tjYkPw	Russians used social media to stir divisions on U.S. energy policy: lawmakers https://t.co/uuM2tjYkPw https://t.co/lK2wjIwhBK	 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian operatives attempting to discourage U.S. energy production posted thousands of messages on social media supporting environmental activists in their campaign to limit oil and gas projects, a report by Republican lawmakers said on Thursday. On Facebook and Instagram, for example, a picture of a real protestor fighting against Energy Transfer Partners’ (ETP.N) Dakota Access Pipeline was presented with a panel written by Russian operatives that said“Americans have been stealing from Native Americans for more than 500 years.” The lawmakers’ report linked some 9,100 posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram between 2015 and 2017 to operatives including the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, a Russian propaganda arm known for its trolling on social media. It was one of three firms indicted on Feb. 16 by a U.S. special counsel investigating intelligence agency allegations of Russian tampering in the 2016 election, charges Moscow denies. Thirteen Russians were also charged, the court document describing them as having“had a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system.” Representative Lamar Smith, the Republican head of the U.S. House of Representatives Science Committee and a denier of climate science, said that Russians benefit by stirring controversy about U.S. energy production because the administration of President Donald Trump is trying to expand oil and natural gas exports to Europe. Russia has traditionally been a major energy supplier to that market. Democrats on the panel and environmentalists criticized Republicans for focusing on energy policy instead of election meddling. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the panel’s report. “The American people deserve to know if what they see on social media is the creation of a foreign power seeking to undermine our domestic energy policy,” Smith said. The report said information provided by Twitter showed more than 4 percent of all tweets by the Internet Research Agency were related to energy or environmental issues, compared to 8 percent of its tweets on the elections. A specialist on energy and foreign policy said the postings likely had little influence on U.S. energy markets. “It’s almost impossible to change U.S. energy policy through a social media campaign,” said Brenda Shaffer, a professor at Georgetown University,“a campaign would have to affect both the state and federal levels to be effective.” Trump has called investigations into possible cooperation between his presidential campaign and Russians a political“witch hunt.” “To ignore known meddling in the very foundation of our democracy while focusing solely on Russia’s influence on the U.S. energy market, a market that is currently booming, seems irresponsible at best,” said Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, the top Democrat on the science committee. Naomi Ages, a climate campaign director at Greenpeace, said Smith was“ignoring the very real threats of election interference and climate change to once again waste taxpayer money muddying the waters.” 
969399465680523266	2018-03-02 02:30:17	https://t.co/VhrjUQvoAV	Facebook ends test that split News Feed in two in six countries https://t.co/VhrjUQvoAV https://t.co/Mw8b61xDL2	 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Thursday put an end to a test of splitting its signature News Feed into two, an idea that roiled how people consumed news in the six countries where it occurred and added to concern about Facebook’s power. The test created two streaming series of posts. One was focused on photos and other updates from friends and family, and a second was called an“explore feed.” It was dedicated to material from Facebook pages that the user had liked, such as media outlets or sports teams. The social media network decided to end the test and maintain one feed because people told the company in surveys they did not like the change, Adam Mosseri, head of the News Feed at Facebook, said in a statement. “People told us they were less satisfied with the posts they were seeing, and having two separate feeds didn’t actually help them connect more with friends and family,” Mosseri said. The test began in October and took place in Bolivia, Cambodia, Guatemala, Serbia, Slovakia and Sri Lanka. It quickly reduced website traffic for smaller media outlets, some of which had built their audiences on Facebook clicks. The test revealed a contradiction in Facebook’s relationship with publishers, whom the social network has also courted as a source of free content, said Leonardo Rodríguez, director of digital development at Guatemala’s Prensa Libre group. “This seemed to me like an abusive practice and shows their control,” Rodríguez said. Mosseri said the company had also“received feedback that we made it harder for people in the test countries to access important information, and that we didn’t communicate the test clearly.” He said Facebook would, in response, revise how it tests product changes. “I hope Facebook will have more interest in what is happening inside its test countries,” Slovakian journalist Filip Struhárik, who had earlier criticized the test, said on Twitter on Thursday. Struhárik said news media websites are stronger now by not relying on Facebook for traffic, and he expects traffic from Facebook to fall further in the long term because of other changes to the News Feed that deemphasize media overall. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has unveiled other changes to the Facebook News Feed in the past two months to fight sensationalism and prioritize posts from friends and family. The world’s largest social network and its competitors are under pressure from users and government authorities to make their services less addictive and to stem the spread of false news stories and hoaxes. “Facebook will have to think about how not to erode freedom of expression, but rather to somehow set limits and protect democratic processes and people,” said Dina Fernández, editorial board president of the Guatemalan website Soy502.

Western countries and rights groups have expressed alarm over the killing by police of more than 4,000 Filipinos since Duterte took office in June 2016, plus hundreds more killings of drug users by unknown gunmen. “When it comes to human rights, or whoever rapporteur it is, my order to you: Do not answer. Do not bother,” Duterte said in a speech before elite armed police units in his home city of Davao late Thursday. “And who are you to interfere in the way I would run my country? You know very well that we are being swallowed by drugs,” Duterte added. The Philippines on Tuesday welcomed a United Nations investigation into Duterte’s signature anti-narcotics campaign, but not if it is conducted by the current U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, who Manila has accused of bias and of not being qualified An International Criminal Court prosecutor has opened a preliminary examination into a complaint accusing Duterte and top officials of crimes against humanity in the anti-drugs campaign. Duterte says he welcomes that and is willing to“rot in jail” to protect Filipinos Human rights advocates have said many of the police killings in the drugs war have been executions. Police deny the allegations, saying they had to use deadly force because the suspects were armed and had resisted arrest. Despite criticism of the Philippine leader’s bloody anti-narcotics campaign, Duterte remains wildly popular and is the country’s most trusted public official, according to opinion polls.

The search came a day after the former head of Odebrecht’s operations in Peru, Jorge Barata, told prosecutors that he had given money to the 2011 presidential campaigns of several politicians, according to Giuliana Loza, a lawyer for Keiko Fujimori, who lost a bid for the presidency and is now the leader of Peru’s most powerful opposition party. Prosecutors have said they are looking into whether Odebrecht’s unreported campaign contributions were part of money laundering and graft schemes. Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] has been at the center of Latin America’s biggest graft scandal since acknowledging in a late 2016 leniency deal that it had bribed officials in a dozen countries, including Peru. Barata, who is a state’s witness, also testified that he had given money for political campaigning to the National Confederation of Private Business Institutions (Confiep), Peru’s biggest business lobby, Loza told journalists on Wednesday. Confiep denied reports by local media that it had taken money from Barata to put toward Keiko Fujimori’s presidential campaign. “Confiep, as a business association, does not support campaigns or political parties,” it said in a statement, adding that it was cooperating with prosecutors. Fujimori has denied that any money from Barata or Odebrecht ever entered her campaign. The Odebrecht scandal nearly toppled President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in December after Congress revealed that he had not disclosed his past business ties to the company. 
969385759517171712	2018-03-02 01:35:50	https://t.co/Ex5cRk0lLN	China ready to build larger aircraft carriers, paper says https://t.co/Ex5cRk0lLN	 BEIJING (Reuters) - China is ready to build larger aircraft carriers having mastered the technical ability to do so, a major state-run newspaper said on Friday ahead of the release of the country’s annual defense budget. President Xi Jinping pledged in October to turn China’s military into a world-class fighting force by 2050 and has made new technology development a key policy plank, investing in stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and missiles. China already has one operational carrier, the second-hand Soviet-era Liaoning bought from Ukraine in 1998, and is carrying out tests on its first indigenously built carrier, launched last year and expected to enter service in 2020. Liu Zheng, chairman of Dalian Shipbuilding Industry in Liaoning province, said his company and its parent, China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, the world’s largest shipbuilder, could design and build carriers. “We have complete ownership of the expertise, in terms of design, technology, technique, manufacturing and project management, that is needed to make an advanced carrier,” Liu told the official China Daily ahead of Monday’s opening of the annual session of parliament. “We are ready to build larger ones,” he said. China Shipbuilding said earlier this week they were developing technologies to build a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Little is known about China’s aircraft carrier program, which is a state secret. State media has quoted experts as saying that China needs at least six carriers, an endeavor expected to take decades. The United States operates 10 and plans to build two more. China’s navy has been taking an increasingly prominent role over the past year, with its first aircraft carrier sailing around self-ruled Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places. China unveils its 2018 defense budget when parliament opens next week, a closely watched figure around the region and in Washington for signs of China’s strategic intentions. 
969384370309140480	2018-03-02 01:30:18	https://t.co/6qYPmcjlVm	Unhappy Canada vows to retaliate against any U.S. steel tariffs https://t.co/6qYPmcjlVm https://t.co/PGThckbYJa	 OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will retaliate against any U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum products, officials said on Thursday, as Ottawa faced what could be one of the biggest economic threats since Donald Trump became president. Trump unveiled the tariffs on Thursday but did not make clear whether they would apply to Canada and Mexico, which together with the United States are trying to renegotiate the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. “Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,” Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement, calling any trade restrictions“absolutely unacceptable.” She did not give details, and Canadian officials were not immediately available for comment on what measures she might have in mind. Canada sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States and would be vulnerable if a trade war erupted. Canada is also the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the United States. Miner Rio Tinto, the largest producer of aluminum in Canada, Alcoa Corp and the United Steelworkers union, which represents workers in both the United States and Canada, all said Canada should be spared from any tariffs. A Canadian government official, asked whether Ottawa would be pressing for an exemption, said“Our efforts have never diminished nor altered” since the question of possible steel tariffs first emerged last year. Canada buys more American steel than any other country, accounting for 50 percent of U.S. exports, and the steel and aluminum industry is highly integrated, Freeland said. Joseph Galimberti, president of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, said there was still room for Canada to be granted an exemption. “The government has been quite active ... in putting forward the case for our exemption and we expect them to continue to do so,” he said by phone. The Trump administration - which Freeland generally describes as the most protectionist since the 1930s - has sought to impose tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber and aircraft over the last year. Canada pushed back on both occasions and won a victory in January when a U.S. tribunal rejected Boeing Co’s calls for punitive duties against Bombardier Corp passenger jets. “We will always be there to defend workers and industry. We showed it on softwood lumber and showed it with the Boeing case,” Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa. CIBC economists Royce Mendes and Avery Shenfeld said the tariffs“could be more biting for the Canadian economy than previous moves by the administration” and said the prospects for retaliation were limited. “In many cases, Canada doesn’t have a domestic source of supply that would benefit from hitting U.S. goods with a tariff,” they said in a note to clients. International trade lawyer Mark Warner said Canada could if it wished quickly apply tariffs on steel or aluminum or other targeted products. “My hope is that the government does not respond precipitously in tone or action and continues to work for an exemption,” he said by e-mail. Milos Barutciski, head of the international trade practice at law firm Bennett Jones, said Canada could also impose sanctions by applying for permission through the World Trade Organization - a process that can take 18 months. 
969380437717069826	2018-03-02 01:14:41	https://t.co/TnOXJn3kIE	Colombia, U.S. seek to halve cocaine output in five years https://t.co/TnOXJn3kIE	 BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia and the United States agreed on Thursday to work together to reduce by half the production of cocaine, and cultivation of its raw material coca in the South American nation within five years. Coca leaf, which is turned into cocaine using various chemicals and fertilizers, covered 188,000 hectares of Colombia at the end of 2016, while potential production of cocaine reached 910 metric tons, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). “This effort includes the national implementation of a comprehensive anti-narcotics strategy that aims to reduce estimated cocaine production and coca cultivation by 50 percent by 2023,” U.S. Under Secretary of Political Affairs Thomas Shannon said at the end of a meeting with Colombia’s foreign minister. Details were not provided on how they would achieve the reduction. Colombia is one of the leading producers and traffickers of cocaine. The United States is the main consumer of Colombian cocaine and provides military and economic aid to fight the illegal drugs industry. Between 2000 and 2015, Colombia received about $10 billion for military and social programs. The U.S. government now provides about $400 million annually to Colombia. Colombia’s Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin said she appreciated support from the United States over the years. “On the issue of security and the fight against a world drug problem, we continue to unite, and we know that by working together we can one day make Colombia a drug-free country,” she said in a statement. 
969378403609702400	2018-03-02 01:06:36	https://t.co/n0I1t20Sr0	China media makes war threat over U.S. Taiwan bill https://t.co/n0I1t20Sr0	 BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media threatened on Friday that the country could go to war over Taiwan if the United States passes into law a bill promoting closer U.S. ties with the self-ruled island that China claims as its own. The legislation, which only needs President Donald Trump’s signature to become law, says it should be U.S. policy to allow officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan to meet their Taiwanese counterparts, permit high-level Taiwanese officials to enter the United States“under respectful conditions” and meet with U.S. officials. Beijing considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and integral part of“one China”, ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. In a strongly-worded editorial, the official China Daily said if the bill becomes law it will only encourage Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen to further assert the island’s sovereignty. “Which, if she persisted, would lead to the inevitable consequence of triggering the Anti-Secession Law that allows Beijing to use force to prevent the island from seceding,” the paper said, referring to a Chinese law passed in 2005. “Since the U.S. is bound by domestic law to act on behalf of the island in that instance, it would only give substance to the observation that the descent into hell is easy.” China’s hostility towards Taiwan has risen since the election to president of Tsai from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party in 2016. China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though she has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace. Taiwan has welcomed the U.S. legislation. In a second editorial, the widely-read state-run Global Times tabloid said China could“make targeted measures against pro-independence forces in Taiwan”. “Militarily, the strength of the People’s Liberation Army has fundamentally changed the military and political situation across the Straits,” it said, talking about the narrow waterway that separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor. “Thanks to its rapid growth, the Chinese mainland is now granted unparalleled strategic initiative across the Taiwan Straits.” China has dramatically upped its military presence around Taiwan. China’s air force has carried out 16 rounds of exercises close to Taiwan in the last year or so, said Taiwan’s defense ministry in late December, warning that China’s military threat was growing by the day. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island’s main source of arms. China regularly says Taiwan is the most sensitive issue in its ties with Washington. 
969372950670569473	2018-03-02 00:44:56	https://t.co/AzKHLqZnBD	P&amp;G says cut digital ad spend by $200 million in 2017 https://t.co/AzKHLqZnBD https://t.co/UT6CUtxrjo	 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) said on Thursday it cut digital advertising spend by $200 million last year based on viewership data provided by tech and media companies that showed its ads were not reaching its target audience effectively. P&G, the world’s biggest advertiser, has been at the forefront of a campaign to pressure digital media companies to be transparent with their viewership metrics by telling them how many people see their ads and how ad agencies spend advertising dollars. These efforts have led tech companies such as Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube to rework algorithms to check content quality, empower marketers with more control on their ads and protect them from being associated with unrelated or inappropriate content. “Transparency shined a spotlight on reality and we learned valuable lessons which are driving profound change,” Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief brand officer said at the Association of National Advertisers’ media conference in Orlando, Florida on Thursday. “With transparent viewability data, we learned that the average view time for an ad on a mobile newsfeed is 1.7 seconds – little more than a glance – pushing us to innovate.” Pritchard said fresh data on ad consumption encouraged P&G to reduce digital spending to several big media companies by 20 percent to 50 percent last year. The consumer goods conglomerate said it cut digital spending by more $100 million between April and June of 2017 and continued with the cuts at the same rate for the rest of the year. P&G, however, has not cut overall media spending. Funds have been reinvested to increase media reach, including in areas such as TV, audio and ecommerce media, a company spokeswoman told Reuters. P&G’s advertising costs, which includes spends on worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising, were $7.1 billion in 2017, down from $7.2 billion in 2016. Its digital spending amounts to a third of the total spend. 
969370938600054785	2018-03-02 00:36:56	https://t.co/Vo4U5h1m3t	Colombia's FARC leader Timochenko hospitalized with chest pains https://t.co/Vo4U5h1m3t	 BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian former FARC rebel leader Rodrigo Londono, known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, was hospitalized on Thursday with chest pains and is under observation, the group said in a statement. Timochenko, who in late 2016 signed a peace agreement with the government and is now a presidential candidate, suffers from heart problems and had surgery in Cuba while negotiating the accord. The former rebel commander was taken to hospital with chest pains after conducting his daily exercise routine, the group said. Timochenko is running for president for the group’s new political party, which kept its famous initials by renaming itself the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force. He suspended campaigning last month due to security concerns after angry protests disrupted campaign stops. Many Colombians remain angry at the FARC, infamous for kidnappings, bombings and displacements, and believe its members should be in prison, not campaigning. Recent opinion polls have shown Timochenko has as little as 1 percent support. The party has focused its political platform on fighting poverty. 
969369274556080128	2018-03-02 00:30:19	https://t.co/hCW9dpDUfG	Trump says U.S. to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum imports https://t.co/hCW9dpDUfG https://t.co/wIC85NXWsS	 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum next week. At a meeting with U.S. industry officials at the White House, Trump vowed to rebuild American steel and aluminum industries, saying they had been treaded unfairly by other countries for decades. The move is likely to increase tensions with China, whose top trade official Lui He is in Washington for trade talks. An early morning tweet from Trump that said the steel and aluminum sectors needed protecting from unfair trade drove shares in domestic industries sharply higher. AK Steel Holding (AKS.N) was up 2.8 percent, U.S. Steel Corp (X.N) was up 2.3 percent and Nucor (NUE.N) rose 1 percent. By contrast, industrial stocks such as Boeing fell, with traders citing tariffs, which would hit manufacturers. The administration says duties would protect U.S. industry, but critics say they would raise costs for industry and fail to deliver on a campaign pledge to boost domestic jobs. Trump tweeted on Thursday that American steel and aluminum companies needed“free, fair and smart trade”. Trump has indicated he favors a duty of 24 percent on steel imports. The administration has also cited national security interests for its action, saying the United States needs domestic supply for its tanks and warships. The Department of Defense has recommended targeted steel tariffs and a delay in aluminum duties. Although China only accounts for two percent of U.S. steel imports, its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices. China has indicated it could retaliate against U.S. steel tariffs by targeting imports of U.S. agricultural commodities, such as soybeans of which America is the largest supplier. Trade tensions between the United States and China have risen since Trump took office in 2017 and the administration is also pushing on what it regards as forced technology transfers to China. Shares of Asian steel producers such as South Korea’s POSCO (005490.KS) and Nippon Steel (5401.T) fell overnight. While American steelmakers have lost three quarters of their jobs between 1962 and 2005, a major study by the American Economic Association showed that much of this had been due to improved production technology as output per worker rose fivefold. “Thus, even if trade protection leads to increased domestic production, increases in employment may be far less than many hope,” a report from the highly-regarded independent Econofact economist network said last week. Consumers of steel and aluminum have lobbied hard against the tariffs. Econofact said in its report that two million jobs were in industries that use steel“intensively”, including auto parts, household appliances, farm machinery and oil equipment. Jobs in the consuming industries are concentrated in California, Texas, the Northeastern and Midwestern states that comprise the rust belt and states in the Southeast. “Across many states, the number of jobs adversely affected in these steel-using industries could far exceed any steel jobs saved,” Econofact warned. “Past experience also shows that unilateral action like Section 232 tariffs will invite retaliation — the Bush-era steel tariffs led many countries to target politically sensitive U.S. exports like Florida oranges and North Carolina textiles.”

The brave 21-year-old student was filmed by a witness as she firmly held the man with one hand while using the other to phone the authorities. The man, named as Manish Kumar, was prevented from fighting his way out by the large crowd that gathered in the market in the Karol Bagh area of the Indian capital. He is seen on the video trying to hide his face from the multiple cameras suddenly pointed at him while at the same time trying to apologise. The unnamed student said he was one of two men who harassed her. She told local media: 'There were three men in a rickshaw. Two of them were constantly making lewd comments and obscene gestures. 'The third man did not do anything. At first, we tried to avoid them but they kept stalking us. Two of them even followed us around while making vulgar comments.' She said she took them to task over their behaviour, after which they became even more abusive. The woman added: 'Passers-by helped me catch the man. I had called up the police control room but before [they arrived], a traffic official spotted me on the road and offered help. 'The traffic policeman caught hold of the man and, with the help of a passer-by, took us to the police station.' Karol Bagh police then devised a plan to hunt town the Kumar's alleged accomplice. They forced Kumar to call the other man, named only as Abhishek, and ask him to come to the police station, saying the charges had been dropped and that the woman only wanted a 'compromise'. When he arrived, he was arrested. The victim made a public statement, saying: 'I want to thank the police and locals for helping me catch the two men. This is not the first time I have been harassed on the road but I decided to hit back this time because despite being ignored, they persisted and followed me.' Deputy Commissioner of Police M.S. Randhawa confirmed the arrests, adding that they too were students, who said they had come to the market from Haryana 60 miles away to get a laptop repaired. Details of charges against them were not reported.

In the footage, filmed in Durban, South Africa, you can see a number of sharks swimming by while the scuba diver looks on with a GoPro. But suddenly, one agitated Oceanic black tip shark can be seen smashing directly into the camera when it lunges at the diver. Scuba diver Elton Polly, 38, was swimming with two friends off the south coast of Durban when the terrifying incident happened. They were taking part in a baited scuba dive which sees scuba divers use bait to attract sharks and then observe them. The shark in question was startled and in an attempt to get away it charged right at the diver's head, knocking his mask off and the regulator from his mouth. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. Mr Polly filmed the incident with the Oceanic black tip shark on February 24, using his GoPro. The force of the shark knocked the mask off Polly's head, but he was uninjured. He said: 'These type of dives take place daily in that area. The shark was startled and in an attempt to get away, it charged right into the diver's head, knocking his mask off and the regulator from his mouth. Mr Polly, who was underwater with two other divers, said he was able to stay calm and resolve the situation. He said: 'No one was injured and the shark was unharmed too.'

She was found guilty of spreading 'false news' after a recording emerged of her joking that water from the River Nile could give people parasites. Sherine is one of Egypt's most famous singers and doubles up as a judge on the Arabic version of The Voice TV show. Scroll down for video The singer apologised after being caught on tape joking with concert-goers about the cleanliness of Nile water. Judicial officials said she would remain free on bail pending an appeal. In the recording Sherine is asked by a fan about her popular song 'Have You Ever Drunk from the Nile?' The star replied that drinking from the river could lead to bilharzia, which once caused widespread contamination of Egypt's rivers. 'Drink Evian instead,' she joked, referring to the French mineral water. The Egyptian news outlet Ahram said she was ordered to pay £204 as bail, in addition to a fine of about £400. She remains free until her case is concluded. When a complaint against her was first filed in November, the musicians' union in Egypt banned her songs from being broadcast - accusing her of causing 'unjustified ridicule and mockery of our dear Egypt'. The singer said at the time that she made her comment at a concert in the UAE more than a year earlier. 'I apologise from all my heart for any pain I may have caused you... It was a bad joke,' she wrote on her Facebook page at the time. The population of the vast country of Egypt is mostly centred on the banks of the Nile, which flows from the south to the Mediterranean Sea. The charismatic 37-year-old topped the charts in the region before announcing her retirement in 2016, but has since gone back on her decision. Meanwhile another singer, Laila Amer, was also sentenced on Tuesday to two years in prison for 'inciting debauchery and immorality' in a music video. The director and a male actor in the clip received shorter terms. In December at third singer, Shaimaa Ahmed - better known as as Shyma - was jailed for two years after she appeared in a music video in her underwear while suggestively eating a banana. She was too found guilty of inciting debauchery and indecency and was sentenced alongside the video's director. Commentators say that the convictions may in part be linked to the desire of President Sisi to curry favour with conservative Egyptians ahead of elections next month. 
969131849468522496	2018-03-01 08:46:53	https://t.co/WKsXoBu5Vk	World's oldest known figurative tattoos are found on 5,000-year-old Egyptian mummies https://t.co/WKsXoBu5Vk	 The world's earliest figurative tattoos have been discovered on 5,000-year-old Egyptian mummies at the British Museum, rewriting the history of inking. The tattoos are of a wild bull and a Barbary sheep on the upper-arm of a male mummy, and S-shaped motifs on the upper-arm and shoulder of a female. The find dates tattoos containing imagery rather than geometric patterns to 1,000 years earlier than previously thought. Researchers say the discovery 'transforms' our understanding of how people lived during this period. The tattoos were found on male and female 'Gebelein' mummies. The 5,000-year-old male mummy, which is naturally preserved, has been one of the star displays at the British Museum, visited by millions each year, since its discovery in a cemetery over 100 years ago. Previous research revealed that the man, known as Gebelein Man A, died a violent death between the ages of around 18 to 21, from a stab wound to his back. But dark smudges on his arm, which appeared as faint markings under natural light, have now been examined. Infrared technology has now revealed that the smudges were tattoos of two slightly overlapping horned animals well known in Predynastic Egyptian art. Daniel Antoine, the British Museum's curator of physical anthropology, said the male mummy was 'one of the most popular displays at the British Museum'. 'His remains were preserved naturally perhaps because he was buried in the peak of summer or was in a shallow grave,' he added. 'We are very confident that this is tattooing and not painted or decorated. It would have been carried out with some type of needle made from bone or copper. These tattoos push back evidence of tattooing by 1,000 years.' It is likely the man wore the designs as symbolic displays of his strength and virility. Throughout much of the ancient world, both bulls and goats were associated with male power. More abstract s-shaped motifs were also identified on the upper arm and shoulder of a 'mysterious' female mummy, who 'may have been a person of importance'. The designs are under the skin and the pigment is probably soot. They could be crooked staves or throw-sticks, batons or clappers used in ritual dance. The oldest known tattoos in the world were discovered on Ötzi the Iceman, dating from around the same time, but they are purely geometric. 'It is quite a departure to see people putting images on their body and that will have resonance with people today,' the curator said. 'Incredibly, at over 5,000 years of age, they push back the evidence for tattooing in Africa by a millennium.' Previously, archaeologists had thought only women wore tattoos in ancient history. The new discovery shows that such body modifications were practiced on both sexes. The tattoos may have denoted status, bravery and magical knowledge. Both mummies were found in Gebelein in the southern part of Upper Egypt, close to Luxor. They lived between 3351 and 3017 BC, not long before the region was unified by the first pharaoh in 3100 BC. The findings are published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Since his discovery on 19 December 1991 by German hikers, Ötzi has provided a window into early human history. His mummified remains were uncovered in melting glacier in the mountainous border between Austria and Italy. Analysis of the body has told us that he was alive during the Copper Age and died a grisly death. Ötzi, who was 46 at the time of his death, had brown eyes, relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant. Experts discovered a total of 61 tattoos on Ötzi's body using different wavelengths of light to pick them out on the mummy's darkened skin. And in December 2015 they were confirmed to be the world's oldest - beating markings on an unidentified South American Chinchorro mummy. Experts had thought the South American mummy with a moustache-like tattoo on its face died in around 4,000BC, before realising it's younger than Ötzi, who was killed in around 3250 BC. While researchers can't be sure why Ötzi had the tattoos, many think that they served as a form of acupuncture. 'We know that they were real tattoos,' Albert Zink, head of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy told LiveScience. The ancient tattoo artist who applied them 'made the incisions into the skin, and then they put in charcoal mixed with some herbs.' The tattoos, mostly found on Ötzi's lower back and legs, between the knee and food, may have been a way to relieve the effects of chronic pain or injuries. Ötzi was thought to have done a lot of walking in the Alps, which could have resulted in joint pain in his knees and ankles. The 61st tattoo, found on the ribcage, has puzzled researchers who suggest Ötzi may also suffered from chest pain. If the tattoos were not for therapeutic benefit, the researchers say they could have had symbolic or religious significance. Alternatively, they may simply be geometric shapes with no hidden meaning. In March, 2018, figurative tattoos were been discovered on 5,000-year-old Egyptian mummies at the British Museum. Experts said that these were the world's earliest figurative tattoos. The tattoos are of a wild bull and a Barbary sheep on the upper-arm of a male mummy, and S-shaped motifs on the upper-arm and shoulder of a female. The find dates tattoos containing imagery rather than geometric patterns to 1,000 years earlier than previously thought. Researchers said the discovery 'transforms' our understanding of how people lived during this period.

Officials have previously dismissed the notion there are places in the country that police and other outsiders can't visit. But Merkel said she favours a zero-tolerance policy on crime that includes preventing no-go areas, which she called 'areas where nobody dares to go' in an interview with n-tv on Monday. 'There are such areas and one has to call them by their name and do something about them,' she said. Asked to name the areas, Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters today 'the chancellor's words speak for themselves.' Interior Ministry spokesman Johannes Dimroth likewise declined to identify no-go areas, saying security was a matter for local not federal authorities. 
969121771453648896	2018-03-01 08:06:50	https://t.co/3nyuyo0myQ	Revealed: what happens to your brain in the last minutes before you die https://t.co/3nyuyo0myQ	 A wave of electrical activity in our brains called 'spreading depression' appears to mark the final moment before death, researchers have found. Experts examining brain activity in dying patients observed a flurry of activity that appears to precede the fatal shutdown of our most vital organ. The finding suggests that consciousness may still be present for many minutes after the rest of the body has stopped showing signs of life, raising the possibility that for up to five minutes, the process of the brain shutting down could be reversed. Scroll down for video A team of neurologists, including from the Charité–Universitätsmedizin Berlin, continuously monitored electrical signals in the brains of of nine people as they died. Each of the patients - from Berlin, Germany, and Cincinnati, Ohio - had received fatal brain injuries and had 'do not resuscitate' orders. Experts hoped that, by implanting electrodes in the brains of their test subjects, they could uncover the mechanisms and timing of events during the process of dying. They found that even five minutes after a person's heart stops beating their brain cells, or neurons, may still function. But a wave of 'spreading depression' marked the moment that these neurons shutdown before their final, irreversible death. In a written statement lead author Dr Jens Dreier of Universitätsmedizin Berlin said: 'After circulatory arrest, spreading depolarization marks the loss of stored electrochemical energy in brain cells and the onset of toxic processes that eventually lead to death. 'Importantly, it is reversible – up to a point – when the circulation is restored.' Cells die when blood stops flowing, depriving them of the oxygen they need as fuel to function. Scientists reported in October 2017 that they had discovered a person's consciousness continues to work after the body has stopped showing signs of life. That means they may be aware of their own death and there is evidence to suggest someone who has died may even hear their own death being announced by medics. A team from New York University Langone School of Medicine investigated the topic through twin studies in Europe and the US of people who have suffered cardiac arrest and 'come back' to life, in the largest study of its kind. Study author Dr Sam Parnia told Live Science: 'They'll describe watching doctors and nurses working and they'll describe having awareness of full conversations, of visual things that were going on, that would otherwise not be known to them.' He said these recollections were then verified by medical and nursing staff who reported their patients, who were technically dead, could remember details of what they were saying. Doctors define death based on when the heart no longer beats, which then immediately cuts off blood supply to the brain. Once that happens, blood no longer circulates to the brain, which means brain function halts almost instantaneously. You lose all your brain stem reflexes, including your gag reflex and your pupil reflex. The brain's cerebral cortex, which is responsible for thinking and processing information from the five senses, also instantly flatlines. This means that within two to 20 seconds, no brainwaves will be detected on an electric monitor. This sparks a chain reaction of cellular processes that will result in the death of brain cells. However this can take hours after the heart has stopped, researchers said. When this happens, brain cells draw on energy reserves for a few minutes before they shut down completely. This happens when the mechanisms that neurons use to keep ions separated start to fail. Ions are electrically charged particles formed when atoms lose or gain electrons. The breakdown of the barriers between these particles releases a massive amount of electrochemical energy into the brain as neurons frantically attempt to draw in fuel. This process, known as spreading depolarisation or spreading depression, is marked by hyperactivity in the neurons, followed by a sudden silence. However, this silence only marks the final countdown to death and may be reversed for a period, researchers found. Exactly how long this remains the case is still open to debate. A final 'wave' of spreading depression seems to mark the point at which neurons have fired for the last time, although the research team warned that this may still be an unreliable marker for true death. 'The chemical changes that lead to death begin with depolarization,' Dr Jed Hartings of the University of University of Cincinnati's College of Medicine and a member of the research team told Newsweek. 'We've never had a method to diagnose brain death, and we don't have a way to be certain when all capacity for awareness is lost.' While the study doesn't have a direct effect on patient care today, it may lead to improved diagnostic and treatment procedures in the future. The findings may be helpful for developing strategies for dealing with cardiac arrest and stroke that complement efforts to reestablish circulation. They may also inform the debate on organ donation after cardio death, where death is declared between two and ten minutes after the heart stops beating. The full findings were published in the journal Annals of Neurology.

The victims were killed by Japanese soldiers at a Chinese village in 1944, according to reports from Korean media. These sex slaves - euphemistically referred to as 'comfort women' - had been brought to China by the Japanese army during the war to work at military brothels. The release of the footage was significant at this time because the government of Japan attempts to bury the issue, an expert told MailOnline. Mainstream historians say up to 200,000 women were forced to work in Japanese military brothels around Asia from 1932 until the end of World War II. The sex slaves were mostly from Korea. But many were also from China and South-east Asian countries. According to Korea Times, the never-before-seen footage was taken on September 15, 1944, in Tengchong, China's Yunnan Province. The Japanese army invaded the area in May, 1944, and lost their battle against the American and Chinese armies on September 13. Apparently, the sex slaves were killed by the Japanese on the last day of the battle. The shocking footage was released during a conference on sex slavery organised by the city government of Seoul, the capital of South Korea. In the 19-second clip, a soldier, said to be Chinese, could be seen taking a sock off a naked corpse. In another part of the video, smoke appears to rise from a large pile of dead bodies. The footage was discovered last year by a group of Korean scholars in American National Archives and Records Administration, reported Seoul-based Arirang News. According to the same report, more than 70 Korean women were brought to Tengchong by the Japanese troops. Only 23 of them survived after the American and Chinese armies won the battle. Kang Sung-hyun, a professor at Sungkonghoe University in Seoul, is quoted by Korea Herald as he commented on the significance of the footage. 'This video shows the situation and reality Korean comfort women faced at the end of the war at a time when the Japanese government denies the killing of comfort women by Japanese troops.' Park Won-soon, the Mayor of Seoul, is quoted saying: 'We know all too well we shouldn't repeat this tragic history and one part of remembering it is documenting it.' Hiroka Shoji, a researcher at the Amnesty International, said the video was published at crucial timing because Japan is yet to provide full and effective reparation to any individual who has suffered harm as the direct result of its military sexual slavery system. Researcher Shoji told MailOnline: 'The Japanese government has made a prolonged and determined effort to hide behind its legal position on the issue. 'Japan has continued to insist that any obligation to provide reparation was settled in the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty and other bilateral peace treaties and arrangements. 'This standing point has negatively impacted Japan’s relation with countries with survivors of Japan’s military sexual slavery system, including South Korea and China.' The plight of the 'comfort women' is a hugely emotional issue that has for decades marred ties between Japan and its neighbours, South Korea and China. In 2015, Tokyo and Seoul agreed to settle the contentious issue through a landmark deal. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued an apology and agreed to create a £6.7 million (1 billion yen) foundation to help provide support for the victims. A statement by both countries' foreign ministers said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 'expresses anew his most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women'. According to researcher Shoji, the 2015 bilateral agreement between Tokyo and Seoul included a provision that the South Korean government should never again raise the issue and that a Peace Monument in Seoul commemorating the survivors of the military sexual slavery system be removed. 'Acknowledging these crimes under international law, and factually recording them in histories for future generations is an important step to ensure non-repetition and end impunity for crimes of sexual violence committed during armed conflicts,' said researcher Shoji. Last December, Seoul expressed doubts over the 2015 deal with Japan because of an election pledge made by the new government of President Moon Jae-In. President Moon promised to review the unpopular agreement - arranged by his now-jailed predecessor Park Geun-Hye. Most historians agree that as many as 200,000 women, mostly from Korea, were forced to work in Japanese military brothels during WWII. The plight of the women is a hugely emotional issue which continues to strain relations between South Korea and Japan today. For many South Koreans, the issue symbolises the abuses of Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula. The term 'comfort woman' comes from the Japanese euphemism 'jugun ianfu' which refers to women, of various ethnic and social circumstances, who became sex slaves for the Japanese troops before and during WWII. Military brothels existed across the Asia Pacific region in areas occupied by the Japanese forces, including China, the Korean Peninsula and a large part of South-east Asia. The women were forced to have sex with up to 50 Japanese soldiers a day as they were raped and sexually assaulted. Though around 80 per cent were Korean, women from China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma and the Pacific islands were also used as comfort women, according to a San Francisco State University report. The authorities believed the comfort system would enhance the morale of the military and help prevent soldiers from committing sexual violence toward women of occupied territories, which became a real concern after the infamous Nanjing Massacre in China in 1937. They were also concerned with the health of the troops, which prompted close supervision of the hygienic conditions in the comfort stations to help keep STDs under control. Meanwhile many of the women who worked in 'comfort stations' during WWII were given repeated injections of the syphilis treatment compound 606, which left many of them unable to have children. After the war, many of the women were brutally slaughtered and their story was untold until 1991. The only military tribunal concerning the sexual abuse of comfort women took place in Batavia - now Indonesian capital Jakarta - in 1948. Several Japanese military officers were convicted for having forced 35 Dutch women involved in the case into comfort stations. The issue only began to emerge in Korea only in the late 1980s. The Japanese government admitted deception, coercion and official involvement in the recruitment of comfort women in August 1993, but critics said they needed to go much further.
